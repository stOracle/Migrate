mr
sherlock
holmes
who
was
usually
very
late
in
the
mornings
save
upon
those
not
infrequent
occasions
when
he
was
up
all
night
was
seated
at
the
breakfast
table
i
stood
upon
the
hearth
rug
and
picked
up
the
stick
which
our
visitor
had
left
behind
him
the
night
before
it
was
a
fine
thick
piece
of
wood
bulbous
headed
of
the
sort
which
is
known
as
a
penang
lawyer
just
under
the
head
was
a
broad
silver
band
nearly
an
inch
across
to
james
mortimer
m
r
c
s
from
his
friends
of
the
c
c
h
was
engraved
upon
it
with
the
date
it
was
just
such
a
stick
as
the
old
fashioned
family
practitioner
used
to
carry
dignified
solid
and
reassuring
well
watson
what
do
you
make
of
it
holmes
was
sitting
with
his
back
to
me
and
i
had
given
him
no
sign
of
my
occupation
how
did
you
know
what
i
was
doing
i
believe
you
have
eyes
in
the
back
of
your
head
i
have
at
least
a
well
polished
silver
plated
coffee
pot
in
front
of
me
said
he
but
tell
me
watson
what
do
you
make
of
our
visitor
stick
since
we
have
been
so
unfortunate
as
to
miss
him
and
have
no
notion
of
his
errand
this
accidental
souvenir
becomes
of
importance
let
me
hear
you
reconstruct
the
man
by
an
examination
of
it
i
think
said
i
following
as
far
as
i
could
the
methods
of
my
companion
that
dr
mortimer
is
a
successful
elderly
medical
man
well
esteemed
since
those
who
know
him
give
him
this
mark
of
their
appreciation
good
said
holmes
excellent
i
think
also
that
the
probability
is
in
favour
of
his
being
a
country
practitioner
who
does
a
great
deal
of
his
visiting
on
foot
why
so
because
this
stick
though
originally
a
very
handsome
one
has
been
so
knocked
about
that
i
can
hardly
imagine
a
town
practitioner
carrying
it
the
thick
iron
ferrule
is
worn
down
so
it
is
evident
that
he
has
done
a
great
amount
of
walking
with
it
perfectly
sound
said
holmes
and
then
again
there
is
the
friends
of
the
c
c
h
i
should
guess
that
to
be
the
something
hunt
the
local
hunt
to
whose
members
he
has
possibly
given
some
surgical
assistance
and
which
has
made
him
a
small
presentation
in
return
really
watson
you
excel
yourself
said
holmes
pushing
back
his
chair
and
lighting
a
cigarette
i
am
bound
to
say
that
in
all
the
accounts
which
you
have
been
so
good
as
to
give
of
my
own
small
achievements
you
have
habitually
underrated
your
own
abilities
it
may
be
that
you
are
not
yourself
luminous
but
you
are
a
conductor
of
light
some
people
without
possessing
genius
have
a
remarkable
power
of
stimulating
it
i
confess
my
dear
fellow
that
i
am
very
much
in
your
debt
he
had
never
said
as
much
before
and
i
must
admit
that
his
words
gave
me
keen
pleasure
for
i
had
often
been
piqued
by
his
indifference
to
my
admiration
and
to
the
attempts
which
i
had
made
to
give
publicity
to
his
methods
i
was
proud
too
to
think
that
i
had
so
far
mastered
his
system
as
to
apply
it
in
a
way
which
earned
his
approval
he
now
took
the
stick
from
my
hands
and
examined
it
for
a
few
minutes
with
his
naked
eyes
then
with
an
expression
of
interest
he
laid
down
his
cigarette
and
carrying
the
cane
to
the
window
he
looked
over
it
again
with
a
convex
lens
interesting
though
elementary
said
he
as
he
returned
to
his
favourite
corner
of
the
settee
there
are
certainly
one
or
two
indications
upon
the
stick
it
gives
us
the
basis
for
several
deductions
has
anything
escaped
me
i
asked
with
some
self
importance
i
trust
that
there
is
nothing
of
consequence
which
i
have
overlooked
i
am
afraid
my
dear
watson
that
most
of
your
conclusions
were
erroneous
when
i
said
that
you
stimulated
me
i
meant
to
be
frank
that
in
noting
your
fallacies
i
was
occasionally
guided
towards
the
truth
not
that
you
are
entirely
wrong
in
this
instance
the
man
is
certainly
a
country
practitioner
and
he
walks
a
good
deal
then
i
was
right
to
that
extent
but
that
was
all
no
no
my
dear
watson
not
all
by
no
means
all
i
would
suggest
for
example
that
a
presentation
to
a
doctor
is
more
likely
to
come
from
a
hospital
than
from
a
hunt
and
that
when
the
initials
c
c
are
placed
before
that
hospital
the
words
charing
cross
very
naturally
suggest
themselves
you
may
be
right
the
probability
lies
in
that
direction
and
if
we
take
this
as
a
working
hypothesis
we
have
a
fresh
basis
from
which
to
start
our
construction
of
this
unknown
visitor
well
then
supposing
that
c
c
h
does
stand
for
charing
cross
hospital
what
further
inferences
may
we
draw
do
none
suggest
themselves
you
know
my
methods
apply
them
i
can
only
think
of
the
obvious
conclusion
that
the
man
has
practised
in
town
before
going
to
the
country
i
think
that
we
might
venture
a
little
farther
than
this
look
at
it
in
this
light
on
what
occasion
would
it
be
most
probable
that
such
a
presentation
would
be
made
when
would
his
friends
unite
to
give
him
a
pledge
of
their
good
will
obviously
at
the
moment
when
dr
mortimer
withdrew
from
the
service
of
the
hospital
in
order
to
start
a
practice
for
himself
we
know
there
has
been
a
presentation
we
believe
there
has
been
a
change
from
a
town
hospital
to
a
country
practice
is
it
then
stretching
our
inference
too
far
to
say
that
the
presentation
was
on
the
occasion
of
the
change
it
certainly
seems
probable
now
you
will
observe
that
he
could
not
have
been
on
the
staff
of
the
hospital
since
only
a
man
well
established
in
a
london
practice
could
hold
such
a
position
and
such
a
one
would
not
drift
into
the
country
what
was
he
then
if
he
was
in
the
hospital
and
yet
not
on
the
staff
he
could
only
have
been
a
house
surgeon
or
a
house
physician
little
more
than
a
senior
student
and
he
left
five
years
ago
the
date
is
on
the
stick
so
your
grave
middle
aged
family
practitioner
vanishes
into
thin
air
my
dear
watson
and
there
emerges
a
young
fellow
under
thirty
amiable
unambitious
absent
minded
and
the
possessor
of
a
favourite
dog
which
i
should
describe
roughly
as
being
larger
than
a
terrier
and
smaller
than
a
mastiff
i
laughed
incredulously
as
sherlock
holmes
leaned
back
in
his
settee
and
blew
little
wavering
rings
of
smoke
up
to
the
ceiling
as
to
the
latter
part
i
have
no
means
of
checking
you
said
i
but
at
least
it
is
not
difficult
to
find
out
a
few
particulars
about
the
mans
age
and
professional
career
from
my
small
medical
shelf
i
took
down
the
medical
directory
and
turned
up
the
name
there
were
several
mortimers
but
only
one
who
could
be
our
visitor
i
read
his
record
aloud

no
mention
of
that
local
hunt
watson
said
holmes
with
a
mischievous
smile
but
a
country
doctor
as
you
very
astutely
observed
i
think
that
i
am
fairly
justified
in
my
inferences
as
to
the
adjectives
i
said
if
i
remember
right
amiable
unambitious
and
absent
minded
it
is
my
experience
that
it
is
only
an
amiable
man
in
this
world
who
receives
testimonials
only
an
unambitious
one
who
abandons
a
london
career
for
the
country
and
only
an
absent
minded
one
who
leaves
his
stick
and
not
his
visiting
card
after
waiting
an
hour
in
your
room
and
the
dog
has
been
in
the
habit
of
carrying
this
stick
behind
his
master
being
a
heavy
stick
the
dog
has
held
it
tightly
by
the
middle
and
the
marks
of
his
teeth
are
very
plainly
visible
the
dogs
jaw
as
shown
in
the
space
between
these
marks
is
too
broad
in
my
opinion
for
a
terrier
and
not
broad
enough
for
a
mastiff
it
may
have
been
yes
by
jove
it
is
a
curly
haired
spaniel
he
had
risen
and
paced
the
room
as
he
spoke
now
he
halted
in
the
recess
of
the
window
there
was
such
a
ring
of
conviction
in
his
voice
that
i
glanced
up
in
surprise
my
dear
fellow
how
can
you
possibly
be
so
sure
of
that
for
the
very
simple
reason
that
i
see
the
dog
himself
on
our
very
door
step
and
there
is
the
ring
of
its
owner
dont
move
i
beg
you
watson
he
is
a
professional
brother
of
yours
and
your
presence
may
be
of
assistance
to
me
now
is
the
dramatic
moment
of
fate
watson
when
you
hear
a
step
upon
the
stair
which
is
walking
into
your
life
and
you
know
not
whether
for
good
or
ill
what
does
dr
james
mortimer
the
man
of
science
ask
of
sherlock
holmes
the
specialist
in
crime
come
in
the
appearance
of
our
visitor
was
a
surprise
to
me
since
i
had
expected
a
typical
country
practitioner
he
was
a
very
tall
thin
man
with
a
long
nose
like
a
beak
which
jutted
out
between
two
keen
gray
eyes
set
closely
together
and
sparkling
brightly
from
behind
a
pair
of
gold
rimmed
glasses
he
was
clad
in
a
professional
but
rather
slovenly
fashion
for
his
frock
coat
was
dingy
and
his
trousers
frayed
though
young
his
long
back
was
already
bowed
and
he
walked
with
a
forward
thrust
of
his
head
and
a
general
air
of
peering
benevolence
as
he
entered
his
eyes
fell
upon
the
stick
in
holmess
hand
and
he
ran
towards
it
with
an
exclamation
of
joy
i
am
so
very
glad
said
he
i
was
not
sure
whether
i
had
left
it
here
or
in
the
shipping
office
i
would
not
lose
that
stick
for
the
world
a
presentation
i
see
said
holmes
yes
sir
from
charing
cross
hospital
from
one
or
two
friends
there
on
the
occasion
of
my
marriage
dear
dear
thats
bad
said
holmes
shaking
his
head
dr
mortimer
blinked
through
his
glasses
in
mild
astonishment
why
was
it
bad
only
that
you
have
disarranged
our
little
deductions
your
marriage
you
say
yes
sir
i
married
and
so
left
the
hospital
and
with
it
all
hopes
of
a
consulting
practice
it
was
necessary
to
make
a
home
of
my
own
come
come
we
are
not
so
far
wrong
after
all
said
holmes
and
now
dr
james
mortimer
mister
sir
mister
a
humble
m
r
c
s
and
a
man
of
precise
mind
evidently
a
dabbler
in
science
mr
holmes
a
picker
up
of
shells
on
the
shores
of
the
great
unknown
ocean
i
presume
that
it
is
mr
sherlock
holmes
whom
i
am
addressing
and
not
no
this
is
my
friend
dr
watson
glad
to
meet
you
sir
i
have
heard
your
name
mentioned
in
connection
with
that
of
your
friend
you
interest
me
very
much
mr
holmes
i
had
hardly
expected
so
dolichocephalic
a
skull
or
such
well
marked
supra
orbital
development
would
you
have
any
objection
to
my
running
my
finger
along
your
parietal
fissure
a
cast
of
your
skull
sir
until
the
original
is
available
would
be
an
ornament
to
any
anthropological
museum
it
is
not
my
intention
to
be
fulsome
but
i
confess
that
i
covet
your
skull
sherlock
holmes
waved
our
strange
visitor
into
a
chair
you
are
an
enthusiast
in
your
line
of
thought
i
perceive
sir
as
i
am
in
mine
said
he
i
observe
from
your
forefinger
that
you
make
your
own
cigarettes
have
no
hesitation
in
lighting
one
the
man
drew
out
paper
and
tobacco
and
twirled
the
one
up
in
the
other
with
surprising
dexterity
he
had
long
quivering
fingers
as
agile
and
restless
as
the
antennae
of
an
insect
holmes
was
silent
but
his
little
darting
glances
showed
me
the
interest
which
he
took
in
our
curious
companion
i
presume
sir
said
he
at
last
that
it
was
not
merely
for
the
purpose
of
examining
my
skull
that
you
have
done
me
the
honour
to
call
here
last
night
and
again
today
no
sir
no
though
i
am
happy
to
have
had
the
opportunity
of
doing
that
as
well
i
came
to
you
mr
holmes
because
i
recognized
that
i
am
myself
an
unpractical
man
and
because
i
am
suddenly
confronted
with
a
most
serious
and
extraordinary
problem
recognizing
as
i
do
that
you
are
the
second
highest
expert
in
europe
indeed
sir
may
i
inquire
who
has
the
honour
to
be
the
first
asked
holmes
with
some
asperity
to
the
man
of
precisely
scientific
mind
the
work
of
monsieur
bertillon
must
always
appeal
strongly
then
had
you
not
better
consult
him
i
said
sir
to
the
precisely
scientific
mind
but
as
a
practical
man
of
affairs
it
is
acknowledged
that
you
stand
alone
i
trust
sir
that
i
have
not
inadvertently
just
a
little
said
holmes
i
think
dr
mortimer
you
would
do
wisely
if
without
more
ado
you
would
kindly
tell
me
plainly
what
the
exact
nature
of
the
problem
is
in
which
you
demand
my
assistance
chapter
the
curse
of
the
baskervilles
i
have
in
my
pocket
a
manuscript
said
dr
james
mortimer
i
observed
it
as
you
entered
the
room
said
holmes
it
is
an
old
manuscript
early
eighteenth
century
unless
it
is
a
forgery
how
can
you
say
that
sir
you
have
presented
an
inch
or
two
of
it
to
my
examination
all
the
time
that
you
have
been
talking
it
would
be
a
poor
expert
who
could
not
give
the
date
of
a
document
within
a
decade
or
so
you
may
possibly
have
read
my
little
monograph
upon
the
subject
i
put
that
at
the
exact
date
is
dr
mortimer
drew
it
from
his
breast
pocket
this
family
paper
was
committed
to
my
care
by
sir
charles
baskerville
whose
sudden
and
tragic
death
some
three
months
ago
created
so
much
excitement
in
devonshire
i
may
say
that
i
was
his
personal
friend
as
well
as
his
medical
attendant
he
was
a
strong
minded
man
sir
shrewd
practical
and
as
unimaginative
as
i
am
myself
yet
he
took
this
document
very
seriously
and
his
mind
was
prepared
for
just
such
an
end
as
did
eventually
overtake
him
holmes
stretched
out
his
hand
for
the
manuscript
and
flattened
it
upon
his
knee
you
will
observe
watson
the
alternative
use
of
the
long
s
and
the
short
it
is
one
of
several
indications
which
enabled
me
to
fix
the
date
i
looked
over
his
shoulder
at
the
yellow
paper
and
the
faded
script
at
the
head
was
written
baskerville
hall
and
below
in
large
scrawling
figures
it
appears
to
be
a
statement
of
some
sort
yes
it
is
a
statement
of
a
certain
legend
which
runs
in
the
baskerville
family
but
i
understand
that
it
is
something
more
modern
and
practical
upon
which
you
wish
to
consult
me
most
modern
a
most
practical
pressing
matter
which
must
be
decided
within
twenty
four
hours
but
the
manuscript
is
short
and
is
intimately
connected
with
the
affair
with
your
permission
i
will
read
it
to
you
holmes
leaned
back
in
his
chair
placed
his
finger
tips
together
and
closed
his
eyes
with
an
air
of
resignation
dr
mortimer
turned
the
manuscript
to
the
light
and
read
in
a
high
cracking
voice
the
following
curious
old
world
narrative
of
the
origin
of
the
hound
of
the
baskervilles
there
have
been
many
statements
yet
as
i
come
in
a
direct
line
from
hugo
baskerville
and
as
i
had
the
story
from
my
father
who
also
had
it
from
his
i
have
set
it
down
with
all
belief
that
it
occurred
even
as
is
here
set
forth
and
i
would
have
you
believe
my
sons
that
the
same
justice
which
punishes
sin
may
also
most
graciously
forgive
it
and
that
no
ban
is
so
heavy
but
that
by
prayer
and
repentance
it
may
be
removed
learn
then
from
this
story
not
to
fear
the
fruits
of
the
past
but
rather
to
be
circumspect
in
the
future
that
those
foul
passions
whereby
our
family
has
suffered
so
grievously
may
not
again
be
loosed
to
our
undoing
know
then
that
in
the
time
of
the
great
rebellion
the
history
of
which
by
the
learned
lord
clarendon
i
most
earnestly
commend
to
your
attention
this
manor
of
baskerville
was
held
by
hugo
of
that
name
nor
can
it
be
gainsaid
that
he
was
a
most
wild
profane
and
godless
man
this
in
truth
his
neighbours
might
have
pardoned
seeing
that
saints
have
never
flourished
in
those
parts
but
there
was
in
him
a
certain
wanton
and
cruel
humour
which
made
his
name
a
by
word
through
the
west
it
chanced
that
this
hugo
came
to
love
if
indeed
so
dark
a
passion
may
be
known
under
so
bright
a
name
the
daughter
of
a
yeoman
who
held
lands
near
the
baskerville
estate
but
the
young
maiden
being
discreet
and
of
good
repute
would
ever
avoid
him
for
she
feared
his
evil
name
so
it
came
to
pass
that
one
michaelmas
this
hugo
with
five
or
six
of
his
idle
and
wicked
companions
stole
down
upon
the
farm
and
carried
off
the
maiden
her
father
and
brothers
being
from
home
as
he
well
knew
when
they
had
brought
her
to
the
hall
the
maiden
was
placed
in
an
upper
chamber
while
hugo
and
his
friends
sat
down
to
a
long
carouse
as
was
their
nightly
custom
now
the
poor
lass
upstairs
was
like
to
have
her
wits
turned
at
the
singing
and
shouting
and
terrible
oaths
which
came
up
to
her
from
below
for
they
say
that
the
words
used
by
hugo
baskerville
when
he
was
in
wine
were
such
as
might
blast
the
man
who
said
them
at
last
in
the
stress
of
her
fear
she
did
that
which
might
have
daunted
the
bravest
or
most
active
man
for
by
the
aid
of
the
growth
of
ivy
which
covered
and
still
covers
the
south
wall
she
came
down
from
under
the
eaves
and
so
homeward
across
the
moor
there
being
three
leagues
betwixt
the
hall
and
her
fathers
farm
it
chanced
that
some
little
time
later
hugo
left
his
guests
to
carry
food
and
drink
with
other
worse
things
perchance
to
his
captive
and
so
found
the
cage
empty
and
the
bird
escaped
then
as
it
would
seem
he
became
as
one
that
hath
a
devil
for
rushing
down
the
stairs
into
the
dining
hall
he
sprang
upon
the
great
table
flagons
and
trenchers
flying
before
him
and
he
cried
aloud
before
all
the
company
that
he
would
that
very
night
render
his
body
and
soul
to
the
powers
of
evil
if
he
might
but
overtake
the
wench
and
while
the
revellers
stood
aghast
at
the
fury
of
the
man
one
more
wicked
or
it
may
be
more
drunken
than
the
rest
cried
out
that
they
should
put
the
hounds
upon
her
whereat
hugo
ran
from
the
house
crying
to
his
grooms
that
they
should
saddle
his
mare
and
unkennel
the
pack
and
giving
the
hounds
a
kerchief
of
the
maids
he
swung
them
to
the
line
and
so
off
full
cry
in
the
moonlight
over
the
moor
now
for
some
space
the
revellers
stood
agape
unable
to
understand
all
that
had
been
done
in
such
haste
but
anon
their
bemused
wits
awoke
to
the
nature
of
the
deed
which
was
like
to
be
done
upon
the
moorlands
everything
was
now
in
an
uproar
some
calling
for
their
pistols
some
for
their
horses
and
some
for
another
flask
of
wine
but
at
length
some
sense
came
back
to
their
crazed
minds
and
the
whole
of
them
thirteen
in
number
took
horse
and
started
in
pursuit
the
moon
shone
clear
above
them
and
they
rode
swiftly
abreast
taking
that
course
which
the
maid
must
needs
have
taken
if
she
were
to
reach
her
own
home
they
had
gone
a
mile
or
two
when
they
passed
one
of
the
night
shepherds
upon
the
moorlands
and
they
cried
to
him
to
know
if
he
had
seen
the
hunt
and
the
man
as
the
story
goes
was
so
crazed
with
fear
that
he
could
scarce
speak
but
at
last
he
said
that
he
had
indeed
seen
the
unhappy
maiden
with
the
hounds
upon
her
track
but
i
have
seen
more
than
that
said
he
for
hugo
baskerville
passed
me
upon
his
black
mare
and
there
ran
mute
behind
him
such
a
hound
of
hell
as
god
forbid
should
ever
be
at
my
heels
so
the
drunken
squires
cursed
the
shepherd
and
rode
onward
but
soon
their
skins
turned
cold
for
there
came
a
galloping
across
the
moor
and
the
black
mare
dabbled
with
white
froth
went
past
with
trailing
bridle
and
empty
saddle
then
the
revellers
rode
close
together
for
a
great
fear
was
on
them
but
they
still
followed
over
the
moor
though
each
had
he
been
alone
would
have
been
right
glad
to
have
turned
his
horse
head
riding
slowly
in
this
fashion
they
came
at
last
upon
the
hounds
these
though
known
for
their
valour
and
their
breed
were
whimpering
in
a
cluster
at
the
head
of
a
deep
dip
or
goyal
as
we
call
it
upon
the
moor
some
slinking
away
and
some
with
starting
hackles
and
staring
eyes
gazing
down
the
narrow
valley
before
them
the
company
had
come
to
a
halt
more
sober
men
as
you
may
guess
than
when
they
started
the
most
of
them
would
by
no
means
advance
but
three
of
them
the
boldest
or
it
may
be
the
most
drunken
rode
forward
down
the
goyal
now
it
opened
into
a
broad
space
in
which
stood
two
of
those
great
stones
still
to
be
seen
there
which
were
set
by
certain
forgotten
peoples
in
the
days
of
old
the
moon
was
shining
bright
upon
the
clearing
and
there
in
the
centre
lay
the
unhappy
maid
where
she
had
fallen
dead
of
fear
and
of
fatigue
but
it
was
not
the
sight
of
her
body
nor
yet
was
it
that
of
the
body
of
hugo
baskerville
lying
near
her
which
raised
the
hair
upon
the
heads
of
these
three
dare
devil
roysterers
but
it
was
that
standing
over
hugo
and
plucking
at
his
throat
there
stood
a
foul
thing
a
great
black
beast
shaped
like
a
hound
yet
larger
than
any
hound
that
ever
mortal
eye
has
rested
upon
and
even
as
they
looked
the
thing
tore
the
throat
out
of
hugo
baskerville
on
which
as
it
turned
its
blazing
eyes
and
dripping
jaws
upon
them
the
three
shrieked
with
fear
and
rode
for
dear
life
still
screaming
across
the
moor
one
it
is
said
died
that
very
night
of
what
he
had
seen
and
the
other
twain
were
but
broken
men
for
the
rest
of
their
days
such
is
the
tale
my
sons
of
the
coming
of
the
hound
which
is
said
to
have
plagued
the
family
so
sorely
ever
since
if
i
have
set
it
down
it
is
because
that
which
is
clearly
known
hath
less
terror
than
that
which
is
but
hinted
at
and
guessed
nor
can
it
be
denied
that
many
of
the
family
have
been
unhappy
in
their
deaths
which
have
been
sudden
bloody
and
mysterious
yet
may
we
shelter
ourselves
in
the
infinite
goodness
of
providence
which
would
not
forever
punish
the
innocent
beyond
that
third
or
fourth
generation
which
is
threatened
in
holy
writ
to
that
providence
my
sons
i
hereby
commend
you
and
i
counsel
you
by
way
of
caution
to
forbear
from
crossing
the
moor
in
those
dark
hours
when
the
powers
of
evil
are
exalted
this
from
hugo
baskerville
to
his
sons
rodger
and
john
with
instructions
that
they
say
nothing
thereof
to
their
sister
elizabeth
when
dr
mortimer
had
finished
reading
this
singular
narrative
he
pushed
his
spectacles
up
on
his
forehead
and
stared
across
at
mr
sherlock
holmes
the
latter
yawned
and
tossed
the
end
of
his
cigarette
into
the
fire
well
said
he
do
you
not
find
it
interesting
to
a
collector
of
fairy
tales
dr
mortimer
drew
a
folded
newspaper
out
of
his
pocket
now
mr
holmes
we
will
give
you
something
a
little
more
recent
this
is
the
devon
county
chronicle
of
may
th
of
this
year
it
is
a
short
account
of
the
facts
elicited
at
the
death
of
sir
charles
baskerville
which
occurred
a
few
days
before
that
date
my
friend
leaned
a
little
forward
and
his
expression
became
intent
our
visitor
readjusted
his
glasses
and
began
the
recent
sudden
death
of
sir
charles
baskerville
whose
name
has
been
mentioned
as
the
probable
liberal
candidate
for
mid
devon
at
the
next
election
has
cast
a
gloom
over
the
county
though
sir
charles
had
resided
at
baskerville
hall
for
a
comparatively
short
period
his
amiability
of
character
and
extreme
generosity
had
won
the
affection
and
respect
of
all
who
had
been
brought
into
contact
with
him
in
these
days
of
nouveaux
riches
it
is
refreshing
to
find
a
case
where
the
scion
of
an
old
county
family
which
has
fallen
upon
evil
days
is
able
to
make
his
own
fortune
and
to
bring
it
back
with
him
to
restore
the
fallen
grandeur
of
his
line
sir
charles
as
is
well
known
made
large
sums
of
money
in
south
african
speculation
more
wise
than
those
who
go
on
until
the
wheel
turns
against
them
he
realized
his
gains
and
returned
to
england
with
them
it
is
only
two
years
since
he
took
up
his
residence
at
baskerville
hall
and
it
is
common
talk
how
large
were
those
schemes
of
reconstruction
and
improvement
which
have
been
interrupted
by
his
death
being
himself
childless
it
was
his
openly
expressed
desire
that
the
whole
countryside
should
within
his
own
lifetime
profit
by
his
good
fortune
and
many
will
have
personal
reasons
for
bewailing
his
untimely
end
his
generous
donations
to
local
and
county
charities
have
been
frequently
chronicled
in
these
columns
the
circumstances
connected
with
the
death
of
sir
charles
cannot
be
said
to
have
been
entirely
cleared
up
by
the
inquest
but
at
least
enough
has
been
done
to
dispose
of
those
rumours
to
which
local
superstition
has
given
rise
there
is
no
reason
whatever
to
suspect
foul
play
or
to
imagine
that
death
could
be
from
any
but
natural
causes
sir
charles
was
a
widower
and
a
man
who
may
be
said
to
have
been
in
some
ways
of
an
eccentric
habit
of
mind
in
spite
of
his
considerable
wealth
he
was
simple
in
his
personal
tastes
and
his
indoor
servants
at
baskerville
hall
consisted
of
a
married
couple
named
barrymore
the
husband
acting
as
butler
and
the
wife
as
housekeeper
their
evidence
corroborated
by
that
of
several
friends
tends
to
show
that
sir
charless
health
has
for
some
time
been
impaired
and
points
especially
to
some
affection
of
the
heart
manifesting
itself
in
changes
of
colour
breathlessness
and
acute
attacks
of
nervous
depression
dr
james
mortimer
the
friend
and
medical
attendant
of
the
deceased
has
given
evidence
to
the
same
effect
the
facts
of
the
case
are
simple
sir
charles
baskerville
was
in
the
habit
every
night
before
going
to
bed
of
walking
down
the
famous
yew
alley
of
baskerville
hall
the
evidence
of
the
barrymores
shows
that
this
had
been
his
custom
on
the
fourth
of
may
sir
charles
had
declared
his
intention
of
starting
next
day
for
london
and
had
ordered
barrymore
to
prepare
his
luggage
that
night
he
went
out
as
usual
for
his
nocturnal
walk
in
the
course
of
which
he
was
in
the
habit
of
smoking
a
cigar
he
never
returned
at
twelve
oclock
barrymore
finding
the
hall
door
still
open
became
alarmed
and
lighting
a
lantern
went
in
search
of
his
master
the
day
had
been
wet
and
sir
charles
footmarks
were
easily
traced
down
the
alley
halfway
down
this
walk
there
is
a
gate
which
leads
out
on
to
the
moor
there
were
indications
that
sir
charles
had
stood
for
some
little
time
here
he
then
proceeded
down
the
alley
and
it
was
at
the
far
end
of
it
that
his
body
was
discovered
one
fact
which
has
not
been
explained
is
the
statement
of
barrymore
that
his
masters
footprints
altered
their
character
from
the
time
that
he
passed
the
moor
gate
and
that
he
appeared
from
thence
onward
to
have
been
walking
upon
his
toes
one
murphy
a
gipsy
horse
dealer
was
on
the
moor
at
no
great
distance
at
the
time
but
he
appears
by
his
own
confession
to
have
been
the
worse
for
drink
he
declares
that
he
heard
cries
but
is
unable
to
state
from
what
direction
they
came
no
signs
of
violence
were
to
be
discovered
upon
sir
charless
person
and
though
the
doctors
evidence
pointed
to
an
almost
incredible
facial
distortion
so
great
that
dr
mortimer
refused
at
first
to
believe
that
it
was
indeed
his
friend
and
patient
who
lay
before
him
it
was
explained
that
that
is
a
symptom
which
is
not
unusual
in
cases
of
dyspnoea
and
death
from
cardiac
exhaustion
this
explanation
was
borne
out
by
the
post
mortem
examination
which
showed
long
standing
organic
disease
and
the
coroners
jury
returned
a
verdict
in
accordance
with
the
medical
evidence
it
is
well
that
this
is
so
for
it
is
obviously
of
the
utmost
importance
that
sir
charless
heir
should
settle
at
the
hall
and
continue
the
good
work
which
has
been
so
sadly
interrupted
had
the
prosaic
finding
of
the
coroner
not
finally
put
an
end
to
the
romantic
stories
which
have
been
whispered
in
connection
with
the
affair
it
might
have
been
difficult
to
find
a
tenant
for
baskerville
hall
it
is
understood
that
the
next
of
kin
is
mr
henry
baskerville
if
he
be
still
alive
the
son
of
sir
charles
baskerville
younger
brother
the
young
man
when
last
heard
of
was
in
america
and
inquiries
are
being
instituted
with
a
view
to
informing
him
of
his
good
fortune
dr
mortimer
refolded
his
paper
and
replaced
it
in
his
pocket
those
are
the
public
facts
mr
holmes
in
connection
with
the
death
of
sir
charles
baskerville
i
must
thank
you
said
sherlock
holmes
for
calling
my
attention
to
a
case
which
certainly
presents
some
features
of
interest
i
had
observed
some
newspaper
comment
at
the
time
but
i
was
exceedingly
preoccupied
by
that
little
affair
of
the
vatican
cameos
and
in
my
anxiety
to
oblige
the
pope
i
lost
touch
with
several
interesting
english
cases
this
article
you
say
contains
all
the
public
facts
it
does
then
let
me
have
the
private
ones
he
leaned
back
put
his
finger
tips
together
and
assumed
his
most
impassive
and
judicial
expression
in
doing
so
said
dr
mortimer
who
had
begun
to
show
signs
of
some
strong
emotion
i
am
telling
that
which
i
have
not
confided
to
anyone
my
motive
for
withholding
it
from
the
coroners
inquiry
is
that
a
man
of
science
shrinks
from
placing
himself
in
the
public
position
of
seeming
to
indorse
a
popular
superstition
i
had
the
further
motive
that
baskerville
hall
as
the
paper
says
would
certainly
remain
untenanted
if
anything
were
done
to
increase
its
already
rather
grim
reputation
for
both
these
reasons
i
thought
that
i
was
justified
in
telling
rather
less
than
i
knew
since
no
practical
good
could
result
from
it
but
with
you
there
is
no
reason
why
i
should
not
be
perfectly
frank
the
moor
is
very
sparsely
inhabited
and
those
who
live
near
each
other
are
thrown
very
much
together
for
this
reason
i
saw
a
good
deal
of
sir
charles
baskerville
with
the
exception
of
mr
frankland
of
lafter
hall
and
mr
stapleton
the
naturalist
there
are
no
other
men
of
education
within
many
miles
sir
charles
was
a
retiring
man
but
the
chance
of
his
illness
brought
us
together
and
a
community
of
interests
in
science
kept
us
so
he
had
brought
back
much
scientific
information
from
south
africa
and
many
a
charming
evening
we
have
spent
together
discussing
the
comparative
anatomy
of
the
bushman
and
the
hottentot
within
the
last
few
months
it
became
increasingly
plain
to
me
that
sir
charless
nervous
system
was
strained
to
the
breaking
point
he
had
taken
this
legend
which
i
have
read
you
exceedingly
to
heart
so
much
so
that
although
he
would
walk
in
his
own
grounds
nothing
would
induce
him
to
go
out
upon
the
moor
at
night
incredible
as
it
may
appear
to
you
mr
holmes
he
was
honestly
convinced
that
a
dreadful
fate
overhung
his
family
and
certainly
the
records
which
he
was
able
to
give
of
his
ancestors
were
not
encouraging
the
idea
of
some
ghastly
presence
constantly
haunted
him
and
on
more
than
one
occasion
he
has
asked
me
whether
i
had
on
my
medical
journeys
at
night
ever
seen
any
strange
creature
or
heard
the
baying
of
a
hound
the
latter
question
he
put
to
me
several
times
and
always
with
a
voice
which
vibrated
with
excitement
i
can
well
remember
driving
up
to
his
house
in
the
evening
some
three
weeks
before
the
fatal
event
he
chanced
to
be
at
his
hall
door
i
had
descended
from
my
gig
and
was
standing
in
front
of
him
when
i
saw
his
eyes
fix
themselves
over
my
shoulder
and
stare
past
me
with
an
expression
of
the
most
dreadful
horror
i
whisked
round
and
had
just
time
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
something
which
i
took
to
be
a
large
black
calf
passing
at
the
head
of
the
drive
so
excited
and
alarmed
was
he
that
i
was
compelled
to
go
down
to
the
spot
where
the
animal
had
been
and
look
around
for
it
it
was
gone
however
and
the
incident
appeared
to
make
the
worst
impression
upon
his
mind
i
stayed
with
him
all
the
evening
and
it
was
on
that
occasion
to
explain
the
emotion
which
he
had
shown
that
he
confided
to
my
keeping
that
narrative
which
i
read
to
you
when
first
i
came
i
mention
this
small
episode
because
it
assumes
some
importance
in
view
of
the
tragedy
which
followed
but
i
was
convinced
at
the
time
that
the
matter
was
entirely
trivial
and
that
his
excitement
had
no
justification
it
was
at
my
advice
that
sir
charles
was
about
to
go
to
london
his
heart
was
i
knew
affected
and
the
constant
anxiety
in
which
he
lived
however
chimerical
the
cause
of
it
might
be
was
evidently
having
a
serious
effect
upon
his
health
i
thought
that
a
few
months
among
the
distractions
of
town
would
send
him
back
a
new
man
mr
stapleton
a
mutual
friend
who
was
much
concerned
at
his
state
of
health
was
of
the
same
opinion
at
the
last
instant
came
this
terrible
catastrophe
on
the
night
of
sir
charless
death
barrymore
the
butler
who
made
the
discovery
sent
perkins
the
groom
on
horseback
to
me
and
as
i
was
sitting
up
late
i
was
able
to
reach
baskerville
hall
within
an
hour
of
the
event
i
checked
and
corroborated
all
the
facts
which
were
mentioned
at
the
inquest
i
followed
the
footsteps
down
the
yew
alley
i
saw
the
spot
at
the
moor
gate
where
he
seemed
to
have
waited
i
remarked
the
change
in
the
shape
of
the
prints
after
that
point
i
noted
that
there
were
no
other
footsteps
save
those
of
barrymore
on
the
soft
gravel
and
finally
i
carefully
examined
the
body
which
had
not
been
touched
until
my
arrival
sir
charles
lay
on
his
face
his
arms
out
his
fingers
dug
into
the
ground
and
his
features
convulsed
with
some
strong
emotion
to
such
an
extent
that
i
could
hardly
have
sworn
to
his
identity
there
was
certainly
no
physical
injury
of
any
kind
but
one
false
statement
was
made
by
barrymore
at
the
inquest
he
said
that
there
were
no
traces
upon
the
ground
round
the
body
he
did
not
observe
any
but
i
did
some
little
distance
off
but
fresh
and
clear
footprints
footprints
a
mans
or
a
womans
dr
mortimer
looked
strangely
at
us
for
an
instant
and
his
voice
sank
almost
to
a
whisper
as
he
answered
mr
holmes
they
were
the
footprints
of
a
gigantic
hound
chapter
the
problem
i
confess
at
these
words
a
shudder
passed
through
me
there
was
a
thrill
in
the
doctors
voice
which
showed
that
he
was
himself
deeply
moved
by
that
which
he
told
us
holmes
leaned
forward
in
his
excitement
and
his
eyes
had
the
hard
dry
glitter
which
shot
from
them
when
he
was
keenly
interested
you
saw
this
as
clearly
as
i
see
you
and
you
said
nothing
what
was
the
use
how
was
it
that
no
one
else
saw
it
the
marks
were
some
twenty
yards
from
the
body
and
no
one
gave
them
a
thought
i
dont
suppose
i
should
have
done
so
had
i
not
known
this
legend
there
are
many
sheep
dogs
on
the
moor
no
doubt
but
this
was
no
sheep
dog
you
say
it
was
large
enormous
but
it
had
not
approached
the
body
no
what
sort
of
night
was
it
damp
and
raw
but
not
actually
raining
no
what
is
the
alley
like
there
are
two
lines
of
old
yew
hedge
twelve
feet
high
and
impenetrable
the
walk
in
the
centre
is
about
eight
feet
across
is
there
anything
between
the
hedges
and
the
walk
yes
there
is
a
strip
of
grass
about
six
feet
broad
on
either
side
i
understand
that
the
yew
hedge
is
penetrated
at
one
point
by
a
gate
yes
the
wicket
gate
which
leads
on
to
the
moor
is
there
any
other
opening
none
so
that
to
reach
the
yew
alley
one
either
has
to
come
down
it
from
the
house
or
else
to
enter
it
by
the
moor
gate
there
is
an
exit
through
a
summer
house
at
the
far
end
had
sir
charles
reached
this
no
he
lay
about
fifty
yards
from
it
now
tell
me
dr
mortimer
and
this
is
important
the
marks
which
you
saw
were
on
the
path
and
not
on
the
grass
no
marks
could
show
on
the
grass
were
they
on
the
same
side
of
the
path
as
the
moor
gate
yes
they
were
on
the
edge
of
the
path
on
the
same
side
as
the
moor
gate
you
interest
me
exceedingly
another
point
was
the
wicket
gate
closed
closed
and
padlocked
how
high
was
it
about
four
feet
high
then
anyone
could
have
got
over
it
yes
and
what
marks
did
you
see
by
the
wicket
gate
none
in
particular
good
heaven
did
no
one
examine
yes
i
examined
myself
and
found
nothing
it
was
all
very
confused
sir
charles
had
evidently
stood
there
for
five
or
ten
minutes
how
do
you
know
that
because
the
ash
had
twice
dropped
from
his
cigar
excellent
this
is
a
colleague
watson
after
our
own
heart
but
the
marks
he
had
left
his
own
marks
all
over
that
small
patch
of
gravel
i
could
discern
no
others
sherlock
holmes
struck
his
hand
against
his
knee
with
an
impatient
gesture
if
i
had
only
been
there
he
cried
it
is
evidently
a
case
of
extraordinary
interest
and
one
which
presented
immense
opportunities
to
the
scientific
expert
that
gravel
page
upon
which
i
might
have
read
so
much
has
been
long
ere
this
smudged
by
the
rain
and
defaced
by
the
clogs
of
curious
peasants
oh
dr
mortimer
dr
mortimer
to
think
that
you
should
not
have
called
me
in
you
have
indeed
much
to
answer
for
i
could
not
call
you
in
mr
holmes
without
disclosing
these
facts
to
the
world
and
i
have
already
given
my
reasons
for
not
wishing
to
do
so
besides
besides
why
do
you
hesitate
there
is
a
realm
in
which
the
most
acute
and
most
experienced
of
detectives
is
helpless
you
mean
that
the
thing
is
supernatural
i
did
not
positively
say
so
no
but
you
evidently
think
it
since
the
tragedy
mr
holmes
there
have
come
to
my
ears
several
incidents
which
are
hard
to
reconcile
with
the
settled
order
of
nature
for
example
i
find
that
before
the
terrible
event
occurred
several
people
had
seen
a
creature
upon
the
moor
which
corresponds
with
this
baskerville
demon
and
which
could
not
possibly
be
any
animal
known
to
science
they
all
agreed
that
it
was
a
huge
creature
luminous
ghastly
and
spectral
i
have
cross
examined
these
men
one
of
them
a
hard
headed
countryman
one
a
farrier
and
one
a
moorland
farmer
who
all
tell
the
same
story
of
this
dreadful
apparition
exactly
corresponding
to
the
hell
hound
of
the
legend
i
assure
you
that
there
is
a
reign
of
terror
in
the
district
and
that
it
is
a
hardy
man
who
will
cross
the
moor
at
night
and
you
a
trained
man
of
science
believe
it
to
be
supernatural
i
do
not
know
what
to
believe
holmes
shrugged
his
shoulders
i
have
hitherto
confined
my
investigations
to
this
world
said
he
in
a
modest
way
i
have
combated
evil
but
to
take
on
the
father
of
evil
himself
would
perhaps
be
too
ambitious
a
task
yet
you
must
admit
that
the
footmark
is
material
the
original
hound
was
material
enough
to
tug
a
mans
throat
out
and
yet
he
was
diabolical
as
well
i
see
that
you
have
quite
gone
over
to
the
supernaturalists
but
now
dr
mortimer
tell
me
this
if
you
hold
these
views
why
have
you
come
to
consult
me
at
all
you
tell
me
in
the
same
breath
that
it
is
useless
to
investigate
sir
charless
death
and
that
you
desire
me
to
do
it
i
did
not
say
that
i
desired
you
to
do
it
then
how
can
i
assist
you
by
advising
me
as
to
what
i
should
do
with
sir
henry
baskerville
who
arrives
at
waterloo
station
dr
mortimer
looked
at
his
watch
in
exactly
one
hour
and
a
quarter
he
being
the
heir
yes
on
the
death
of
sir
charles
we
inquired
for
this
young
gentleman
and
found
that
he
had
been
farming
in
canada
from
the
accounts
which
have
reached
us
he
is
an
excellent
fellow
in
every
way
i
speak
now
not
as
a
medical
man
but
as
a
trustee
and
executor
of
sir
charless
will
there
is
no
other
claimant
i
presume
none
the
only
other
kinsman
whom
we
have
been
able
to
trace
was
rodger
baskerville
the
youngest
of
three
brothers
of
whom
poor
sir
charles
was
the
elder
the
second
brother
who
died
young
is
the
father
of
this
lad
henry
the
third
rodger
was
the
black
sheep
of
the
family
he
came
of
the
old
masterful
baskerville
strain
and
was
the
very
image
they
tell
me
of
the
family
picture
of
old
hugo
he
made
england
too
hot
to
hold
him
fled
to
central
america
and
died
there
in
of
yellow
fever
henry
is
the
last
of
the
baskervilles
in
one
hour
and
five
minutes
i
meet
him
at
waterloo
station
i
have
had
a
wire
that
he
arrived
at
southampton
this
morning
now
mr
holmes
what
would
you
advise
me
to
do
with
him
why
should
he
not
go
to
the
home
of
his
fathers
it
seems
natural
does
it
not
and
yet
consider
that
every
baskerville
who
goes
there
meets
with
an
evil
fate
i
feel
sure
that
if
sir
charles
could
have
spoken
with
me
before
his
death
he
would
have
warned
me
against
bringing
this
the
last
of
the
old
race
and
the
heir
to
great
wealth
to
that
deadly
place
and
yet
it
cannot
be
denied
that
the
prosperity
of
the
whole
poor
bleak
countryside
depends
upon
his
presence
all
the
good
work
which
has
been
done
by
sir
charles
will
crash
to
the
ground
if
there
is
no
tenant
of
the
hall
i
fear
lest
i
should
be
swayed
too
much
by
my
own
obvious
interest
in
the
matter
and
that
is
why
i
bring
the
case
before
you
and
ask
for
your
advice
holmes
considered
for
a
little
time
put
into
plain
words
the
matter
is
this
said
he
in
your
opinion
there
is
a
diabolical
agency
which
makes
dartmoor
an
unsafe
abode
for
a
baskerville
that
is
your
opinion
at
least
i
might
go
the
length
of
saying
that
there
is
some
evidence
that
this
may
be
so
exactly
but
surely
if
your
supernatural
theory
be
correct
it
could
work
the
young
man
evil
in
london
as
easily
as
in
devonshire
a
devil
with
merely
local
powers
like
a
parish
vestry
would
be
too
inconceivable
a
thing
you
put
the
matter
more
flippantly
mr
holmes
than
you
would
probably
do
if
you
were
brought
into
personal
contact
with
these
things
your
advice
then
as
i
understand
it
is
that
the
young
man
will
be
as
safe
in
devonshire
as
in
london
he
comes
in
fifty
minutes
what
would
you
recommend
i
recommend
sir
that
you
take
a
cab
call
off
your
spaniel
who
is
scratching
at
my
front
door
and
proceed
to
waterloo
to
meet
sir
henry
baskerville
and
then
and
then
you
will
say
nothing
to
him
at
all
until
i
have
made
up
my
mind
about
the
matter
how
long
will
it
take
you
to
make
up
your
mind
twenty
four
hours
at
ten
oclock
tomorrow
dr
mortimer
i
will
be
much
obliged
to
you
if
you
will
call
upon
me
here
and
it
will
be
of
help
to
me
in
my
plans
for
the
future
if
you
will
bring
sir
henry
baskerville
with
you
i
will
do
so
mr
holmes
he
scribbled
the
appointment
on
his
shirt
cuff
and
hurried
off
in
his
strange
peering
absent
minded
fashion
holmes
stopped
him
at
the
head
of
the
stair
only
one
more
question
dr
mortimer
you
say
that
before
sir
charles
baskervilles
death
several
people
saw
this
apparition
upon
the
moor
three
people
did
did
any
see
it
after
i
have
not
heard
of
any
thank
you
good
morning
holmes
returned
to
his
seat
with
that
quiet
look
of
inward
satisfaction
which
meant
that
he
had
a
congenial
task
before
him
going
out
watson
unless
i
can
help
you
no
my
dear
fellow
it
is
at
the
hour
of
action
that
i
turn
to
you
for
aid
but
this
is
splendid
really
unique
from
some
points
of
view
when
you
pass
bradleys
would
you
ask
him
to
send
up
a
pound
of
the
strongest
shag
tobacco
thank
you
it
would
be
as
well
if
you
could
make
it
convenient
not
to
return
before
evening
then
i
should
be
very
glad
to
compare
impressions
as
to
this
most
interesting
problem
which
has
been
submitted
to
us
this
morning
i
knew
that
seclusion
and
solitude
were
very
necessary
for
my
friend
in
those
hours
of
intense
mental
concentration
during
which
he
weighed
every
particle
of
evidence
constructed
alternative
theories
balanced
one
against
the
other
and
made
up
his
mind
as
to
which
points
were
essential
and
which
immaterial
i
therefore
spent
the
day
at
my
club
and
did
not
return
to
baker
street
until
evening
it
was
nearly
nine
oclock
when
i
found
myself
in
the
sitting
room
once
more
my
first
impression
as
i
opened
the
door
was
that
a
fire
had
broken
out
for
the
room
was
so
filled
with
smoke
that
the
light
of
the
lamp
upon
the
table
was
blurred
by
it
as
i
entered
however
my
fears
were
set
at
rest
for
it
was
the
acrid
fumes
of
strong
coarse
tobacco
which
took
me
by
the
throat
and
set
me
coughing
through
the
haze
i
had
a
vague
vision
of
holmes
in
his
dressing
gown
coiled
up
in
an
armchair
with
his
black
clay
pipe
between
his
lips
several
rolls
of
paper
lay
around
him
caught
cold
watson
said
he
no
its
this
poisonous
atmosphere
i
suppose
it
is
pretty
thick
now
that
you
mention
it
thick
it
is
intolerable
open
the
window
then
you
have
been
at
your
club
all
day
i
perceive
my
dear
holmes
am
i
right
certainly
but
how
he
laughed
at
my
bewildered
expression
there
is
a
delightful
freshness
about
you
watson
which
makes
it
a
pleasure
to
exercise
any
small
powers
which
i
possess
at
your
expense
a
gentleman
goes
forth
on
a
showery
and
miry
day
he
returns
immaculate
in
the
evening
with
the
gloss
still
on
his
hat
and
his
boots
he
has
been
a
fixture
therefore
all
day
he
is
not
a
man
with
intimate
friends
where
then
could
he
have
been
is
it
not
obvious
well
it
is
rather
obvious
the
world
is
full
of
obvious
things
which
nobody
by
any
chance
ever
observes
where
do
you
think
that
i
have
been
a
fixture
also
on
the
contrary
i
have
been
to
devonshire
in
spirit
exactly
my
body
has
remained
in
this
armchair
and
has
i
regret
to
observe
consumed
in
my
absence
two
large
pots
of
coffee
and
an
incredible
amount
of
tobacco
after
you
left
i
sent
down
to
stamford
for
the
ordnance
map
of
this
portion
of
the
moor
and
my
spirit
has
hovered
over
it
all
day
i
flatter
myself
that
i
could
find
my
way
about
a
large
scale
map
i
presume
very
large
he
unrolled
one
section
and
held
it
over
his
knee
here
you
have
the
particular
district
which
concerns
us
that
is
baskerville
hall
in
the
middle
with
a
wood
round
it
exactly
i
fancy
the
yew
alley
though
not
marked
under
that
name
must
stretch
along
this
line
with
the
moor
as
you
perceive
upon
the
right
of
it
this
small
clump
of
buildings
here
is
the
hamlet
of
grimpen
where
our
friend
dr
mortimer
has
his
headquarters
within
a
radius
of
five
miles
there
are
as
you
see
only
a
very
few
scattered
dwellings
here
is
lafter
hall
which
was
mentioned
in
the
narrative
there
is
a
house
indicated
here
which
may
be
the
residence
of
the
naturalist
stapleton
if
i
remember
right
was
his
name
here
are
two
moorland
farmhouses
high
tor
and
foulmire
then
fourteen
miles
away
the
great
convict
prison
of
princetown
between
and
around
these
scattered
points
extends
the
desolate
lifeless
moor
this
then
is
the
stage
upon
which
tragedy
has
been
played
and
upon
which
we
may
help
to
play
it
again
it
must
be
a
wild
place
yes
the
setting
is
a
worthy
one
if
the
devil
did
desire
to
have
a
hand
in
the
affairs
of
men
then
you
are
yourself
inclining
to
the
supernatural
explanation
the
devils
agents
may
be
of
flesh
and
blood
may
they
not
there
are
two
questions
waiting
for
us
at
the
outset
the
one
is
whether
any
crime
has
been
committed
at
all
the
second
is
what
is
the
crime
and
how
was
it
committed
of
course
if
dr
mortimers
surmise
should
be
correct
and
we
are
dealing
with
forces
outside
the
ordinary
laws
of
nature
there
is
an
end
of
our
investigation
but
we
are
bound
to
exhaust
all
other
hypotheses
before
falling
back
upon
this
one
i
think
well
shut
that
window
again
if
you
dont
mind
it
is
a
singular
thing
but
i
find
that
a
concentrated
atmosphere
helps
a
concentration
of
thought
i
have
not
pushed
it
to
the
length
of
getting
into
a
box
to
think
but
that
is
the
logical
outcome
of
my
convictions
have
you
turned
the
case
over
in
your
mind
yes
i
have
thought
a
good
deal
of
it
in
the
course
of
the
day
what
do
you
make
of
it
it
is
very
bewildering
it
has
certainly
a
character
of
its
own
there
are
points
of
distinction
about
it
that
change
in
the
footprints
for
example
what
do
you
make
of
that
mortimer
said
that
the
man
had
walked
on
tiptoe
down
that
portion
of
the
alley
he
only
repeated
what
some
fool
had
said
at
the
inquest
why
should
a
man
walk
on
tiptoe
down
the
alley
what
then
he
was
running
watson
running
desperately
running
for
his
life
running
until
he
burst
his
heart
and
fell
dead
upon
his
face
running
from
what
there
lies
our
problem
there
are
indications
that
the
man
was
crazed
with
fear
before
ever
he
began
to
run
how
can
you
say
that
i
am
presuming
that
the
cause
of
his
fears
came
to
him
across
the
moor
if
that
were
so
and
it
seems
most
probable
only
a
man
who
had
lost
his
wits
would
have
run
from
the
house
instead
of
towards
it
if
the
gipsys
evidence
may
be
taken
as
true
he
ran
with
cries
for
help
in
the
direction
where
help
was
least
likely
to
be
then
again
whom
was
he
waiting
for
that
night
and
why
was
he
waiting
for
him
in
the
yew
alley
rather
than
in
his
own
house
you
think
that
he
was
waiting
for
someone
the
man
was
elderly
and
infirm
we
can
understand
his
taking
an
evening
stroll
but
the
ground
was
damp
and
the
night
inclement
is
it
natural
that
he
should
stand
for
five
or
ten
minutes
as
dr
mortimer
with
more
practical
sense
than
i
should
have
given
him
credit
for
deduced
from
the
cigar
ash
but
he
went
out
every
evening
i
think
it
unlikely
that
he
waited
at
the
moor
gate
every
evening
on
the
contrary
the
evidence
is
that
he
avoided
the
moor
that
night
he
waited
there
it
was
the
night
before
he
made
his
departure
for
london
the
thing
takes
shape
watson
it
becomes
coherent
might
i
ask
you
to
hand
me
my
violin
and
we
will
postpone
all
further
thought
upon
this
business
until
we
have
had
the
advantage
of
meeting
dr
mortimer
and
sir
henry
baskerville
in
the
morning
chapter
sir
henry
baskerville
our
breakfast
table
was
cleared
early
and
holmes
waited
in
his
dressing
gown
for
the
promised
interview
our
clients
were
punctual
to
their
appointment
for
the
clock
had
just
struck
ten
when
dr
mortimer
was
shown
up
followed
by
the
young
baronet
the
latter
was
a
small
alert
dark
eyed
man
about
thirty
years
of
age
very
sturdily
built
with
thick
black
eyebrows
and
a
strong
pugnacious
face
he
wore
a
ruddy
tinted
tweed
suit
and
had
the
weather
beaten
appearance
of
one
who
has
spent
most
of
his
time
in
the
open
air
and
yet
there
was
something
in
his
steady
eye
and
the
quiet
assurance
of
his
bearing
which
indicated
the
gentleman
this
is
sir
henry
baskerville
said
dr
mortimer
why
yes
said
he
and
the
strange
thing
is
mr
sherlock
holmes
that
if
my
friend
here
had
not
proposed
coming
round
to
you
this
morning
i
should
have
come
on
my
own
account
i
understand
that
you
think
out
little
puzzles
and
ive
had
one
this
morning
which
wants
more
thinking
out
than
i
am
able
to
give
it
pray
take
a
seat
sir
henry
do
i
understand
you
to
say
that
you
have
yourself
had
some
remarkable
experience
since
you
arrived
in
london
nothing
of
much
importance
mr
holmes
only
a
joke
as
like
as
not
it
was
this
letter
if
you
can
call
it
a
letter
which
reached
me
this
morning
he
laid
an
envelope
upon
the
table
and
we
all
bent
over
it
it
was
of
common
quality
grayish
in
colour
the
address
sir
henry
baskerville
northumberland
hotel
was
printed
in
rough
characters
the
post
mark
charing
cross
and
the
date
of
posting
the
preceding
evening
who
knew
that
you
were
going
to
the
northumberland
hotel
asked
holmes
glancing
keenly
across
at
our
visitor
no
one
could
have
known
we
only
decided
after
i
met
dr
mortimer
but
dr
mortimer
was
no
doubt
already
stopping
there
no
i
had
been
staying
with
a
friend
said
the
doctor
there
was
no
possible
indication
that
we
intended
to
go
to
this
hotel
hum
someone
seems
to
be
very
deeply
interested
in
your
movements
out
of
the
envelope
he
took
a
half
sheet
of
foolscap
paper
folded
into
four
this
he
opened
and
spread
flat
upon
the
table
across
the
middle
of
it
a
single
sentence
had
been
formed
by
the
expedient
of
pasting
printed
words
upon
it
it
ran
as
you
value
your
life
or
your
reason
keep
away
from
the
moor
the
word
moor
only
was
printed
in
ink
now
said
sir
henry
baskerville
perhaps
you
will
tell
me
mr
holmes
what
in
thunder
is
the
meaning
of
that
and
who
it
is
that
takes
so
much
interest
in
my
affairs
what
do
you
make
of
it
dr
mortimer
you
must
allow
that
there
is
nothing
supernatural
about
this
at
any
rate
no
sir
but
it
might
very
well
come
from
someone
who
was
convinced
that
the
business
is
supernatural
what
business
asked
sir
henry
sharply
it
seems
to
me
that
all
you
gentlemen
know
a
great
deal
more
than
i
do
about
my
own
affairs
you
shall
share
our
knowledge
before
you
leave
this
room
sir
henry
i
promise
you
that
said
sherlock
holmes
we
will
confine
ourselves
for
the
present
with
your
permission
to
this
very
interesting
document
which
must
have
been
put
together
and
posted
yesterday
evening
have
you
yesterdays
times
watson
it
is
here
in
the
corner
might
i
trouble
you
for
it
the
inside
page
please
with
the
leading
articles
he
glanced
swiftly
over
it
running
his
eyes
up
and
down
the
columns
capital
article
this
on
free
trade
permit
me
to
give
you
an
extract
from
it
you
may
be
cajoled
into
imagining
that
your
own
special
trade
or
your
own
industry
will
be
encouraged
by
a
protective
tariff
but
it
stands
to
reason
that
such
legislation
must
in
the
long
run
keep
away
wealth
from
the
country
diminish
the
value
of
our
imports
and
lower
the
general
conditions
of
life
in
this
island
what
do
you
think
of
that
watson
cried
holmes
in
high
glee
rubbing
his
hands
together
with
satisfaction
dont
you
think
that
is
an
admirable
sentiment
dr
mortimer
looked
at
holmes
with
an
air
of
professional
interest
and
sir
henry
baskerville
turned
a
pair
of
puzzled
dark
eyes
upon
me
i
dont
know
much
about
the
tariff
and
things
of
that
kind
said
he
but
it
seems
to
me
weve
got
a
bit
off
the
trail
so
far
as
that
note
is
concerned
on
the
contrary
i
think
we
are
particularly
hot
upon
the
trail
sir
henry
watson
here
knows
more
about
my
methods
than
you
do
but
i
fear
that
even
he
has
not
quite
grasped
the
significance
of
this
sentence
no
i
confess
that
i
see
no
connection
and
yet
my
dear
watson
there
is
so
very
close
a
connection
that
the
one
is
extracted
out
of
the
other
you
your
your
life
reason
value
keep
away
from
the
dont
you
see
now
whence
these
words
have
been
taken
by
thunder
youre
right
well
if
that
isnt
smart
cried
sir
henry
if
any
possible
doubt
remained
it
is
settled
by
the
fact
that
keep
away
and
from
the
are
cut
out
in
one
piece
well
now
so
it
is
really
mr
holmes
this
exceeds
anything
which
i
could
have
imagined
said
dr
mortimer
gazing
at
my
friend
in
amazement
i
could
understand
anyone
saying
that
the
words
were
from
a
newspaper
but
that
you
should
name
which
and
add
that
it
came
from
the
leading
article
is
really
one
of
the
most
remarkable
things
which
i
have
ever
known
how
did
you
do
it
i
presume
doctor
that
you
could
tell
the
skull
of
a
negro
from
that
of
an
esquimau
most
certainly
but
how
because
that
is
my
special
hobby
the
differences
are
obvious
the
supra
orbital
crest
the
facial
angle
the
maxillary
curve
the
but
this
is
my
special
hobby
and
the
differences
are
equally
obvious
there
is
as
much
difference
to
my
eyes
between
the
leaded
bourgeois
type
of
a
times
article
and
the
slovenly
print
of
an
evening
half
penny
paper
as
there
could
be
between
your
negro
and
your
esquimau
the
detection
of
types
is
one
of
the
most
elementary
branches
of
knowledge
to
the
special
expert
in
crime
though
i
confess
that
once
when
i
was
very
young
i
confused
the
leeds
mercury
with
the
western
morning
news
but
a
times
leader
is
entirely
distinctive
and
these
words
could
have
been
taken
from
nothing
else
as
it
was
done
yesterday
the
strong
probability
was
that
we
should
find
the
words
in
yesterdays
issue
so
far
as
i
can
follow
you
then
mr
holmes
said
sir
henry
baskerville
someone
cut
out
this
message
with
a
scissors
nail
scissors
said
holmes
you
can
see
that
it
was
a
very
short
bladed
scissors
since
the
cutter
had
to
take
two
snips
over
keep
away
that
is
so
someone
then
cut
out
the
message
with
a
pair
of
short
bladed
scissors
pasted
it
with
paste
gum
said
holmes
with
gum
on
to
the
paper
but
i
want
to
know
why
the
word
moor
should
have
been
written
because
he
could
not
find
it
in
print
the
other
words
were
all
simple
and
might
be
found
in
any
issue
but
moor
would
be
less
common
why
of
course
that
would
explain
it
have
you
read
anything
else
in
this
message
mr
holmes
there
are
one
or
two
indications
and
yet
the
utmost
pains
have
been
taken
to
remove
all
clues
the
address
you
observe
is
printed
in
rough
characters
but
the
times
is
a
paper
which
is
seldom
found
in
any
hands
but
those
of
the
highly
educated
we
may
take
it
therefore
that
the
letter
was
composed
by
an
educated
man
who
wished
to
pose
as
an
uneducated
one
and
his
effort
to
conceal
his
own
writing
suggests
that
that
writing
might
be
known
or
come
to
be
known
by
you
again
you
will
observe
that
the
words
are
not
gummed
on
in
an
accurate
line
but
that
some
are
much
higher
than
others
life
for
example
is
quite
out
of
its
proper
place
that
may
point
to
carelessness
or
it
may
point
to
agitation
and
hurry
upon
the
part
of
the
cutter
on
the
whole
i
incline
to
the
latter
view
since
the
matter
was
evidently
important
and
it
is
unlikely
that
the
composer
of
such
a
letter
would
be
careless
if
he
were
in
a
hurry
it
opens
up
the
interesting
question
why
he
should
be
in
a
hurry
since
any
letter
posted
up
to
early
morning
would
reach
sir
henry
before
he
would
leave
his
hotel
did
the
composer
fear
an
interruption
and
from
whom
we
are
coming
now
rather
into
the
region
of
guesswork
said
dr
mortimer
say
rather
into
the
region
where
we
balance
probabilities
and
choose
the
most
likely
it
is
the
scientific
use
of
the
imagination
but
we
have
always
some
material
basis
on
which
to
start
our
speculation
now
you
would
call
it
a
guess
no
doubt
but
i
am
almost
certain
that
this
address
has
been
written
in
a
hotel
how
in
the
world
can
you
say
that
if
you
examine
it
carefully
you
will
see
that
both
the
pen
and
the
ink
have
given
the
writer
trouble
the
pen
has
spluttered
twice
in
a
single
word
and
has
run
dry
three
times
in
a
short
address
showing
that
there
was
very
little
ink
in
the
bottle
now
a
private
pen
or
ink
bottle
is
seldom
allowed
to
be
in
such
a
state
and
the
combination
of
the
two
must
be
quite
rare
but
you
know
the
hotel
ink
and
the
hotel
pen
where
it
is
rare
to
get
anything
else
yes
i
have
very
little
hesitation
in
saying
that
could
we
examine
the
waste
paper
baskets
of
the
hotels
around
charing
cross
until
we
found
the
remains
of
the
mutilated
times
leader
we
could
lay
our
hands
straight
upon
the
person
who
sent
this
singular
message
halloa
halloa
whats
this
he
was
carefully
examining
the
foolscap
upon
which
the
words
were
pasted
holding
it
only
an
inch
or
two
from
his
eyes
well
nothing
said
he
throwing
it
down
it
is
a
blank
half
sheet
of
paper
without
even
a
water
mark
upon
it
i
think
we
have
drawn
as
much
as
we
can
from
this
curious
letter
and
now
sir
henry
has
anything
else
of
interest
happened
to
you
since
you
have
been
in
london
why
no
mr
holmes
i
think
not
you
have
not
observed
anyone
follow
or
watch
you
i
seem
to
have
walked
right
into
the
thick
of
a
dime
novel
said
our
visitor
why
in
thunder
should
anyone
follow
or
watch
me
we
are
coming
to
that
you
have
nothing
else
to
report
to
us
before
we
go
into
this
matter
well
it
depends
upon
what
you
think
worth
reporting
i
think
anything
out
of
the
ordinary
routine
of
life
well
worth
reporting
sir
henry
smiled
i
dont
know
much
of
british
life
yet
for
i
have
spent
nearly
all
my
time
in
the
states
and
in
canada
but
i
hope
that
to
lose
one
of
your
boots
is
not
part
of
the
ordinary
routine
of
life
over
here
you
have
lost
one
of
your
boots
my
dear
sir
cried
dr
mortimer
it
is
only
mislaid
you
will
find
it
when
you
return
to
the
hotel
what
is
the
use
of
troubling
mr
holmes
with
trifles
of
this
kind
well
he
asked
me
for
anything
outside
the
ordinary
routine
exactly
said
holmes
however
foolish
the
incident
may
seem
you
have
lost
one
of
your
boots
you
say
well
mislaid
it
anyhow
i
put
them
both
outside
my
door
last
night
and
there
was
only
one
in
the
morning
i
could
get
no
sense
out
of
the
chap
who
cleans
them
the
worst
of
it
is
that
i
only
bought
the
pair
last
night
in
the
strand
and
i
have
never
had
them
on
if
you
have
never
worn
them
why
did
you
put
them
out
to
be
cleaned
they
were
tan
boots
and
had
never
been
varnished
that
was
why
i
put
them
out
then
i
understand
that
on
your
arrival
in
london
yesterday
you
went
out
at
once
and
bought
a
pair
of
boots
i
did
a
good
deal
of
shopping
dr
mortimer
here
went
round
with
me
you
see
if
i
am
to
be
squire
down
there
i
must
dress
the
part
and
it
may
be
that
i
have
got
a
little
careless
in
my
ways
out
west
among
other
things
i
bought
these
brown
boots
gave
six
dollars
for
them
and
had
one
stolen
before
ever
i
had
them
on
my
feet
it
seems
a
singularly
useless
thing
to
steal
said
sherlock
holmes
i
confess
that
i
share
dr
mortimers
belief
that
it
will
not
be
long
before
the
missing
boot
is
found
and
now
gentlemen
said
the
baronet
with
decision
it
seems
to
me
that
i
have
spoken
quite
enough
about
the
little
that
i
know
it
is
time
that
you
kept
your
promise
and
gave
me
a
full
account
of
what
we
are
all
driving
at
your
request
is
a
very
reasonable
one
holmes
answered
dr
mortimer
i
think
you
could
not
do
better
than
to
tell
your
story
as
you
told
it
to
us
thus
encouraged
our
scientific
friend
drew
his
papers
from
his
pocket
and
presented
the
whole
case
as
he
had
done
upon
the
morning
before
sir
henry
baskerville
listened
with
the
deepest
attention
and
with
an
occasional
exclamation
of
surprise
well
i
seem
to
have
come
into
an
inheritance
with
a
vengeance
said
he
when
the
long
narrative
was
finished
of
course
ive
heard
of
the
hound
ever
since
i
was
in
the
nursery
its
the
pet
story
of
the
family
though
i
never
thought
of
taking
it
seriously
before
but
as
to
my
uncles
death
well
it
all
seems
boiling
up
in
my
head
and
i
cant
get
it
clear
yet
you
dont
seem
quite
to
have
made
up
your
mind
whether
its
a
case
for
a
policeman
or
a
clergyman
precisely
and
now
theres
this
affair
of
the
letter
to
me
at
the
hotel
i
suppose
that
fits
into
its
place
it
seems
to
show
that
someone
knows
more
than
we
do
about
what
goes
on
upon
the
moor
said
dr
mortimer
and
also
said
holmes
that
someone
is
not
ill
disposed
towards
you
since
they
warn
you
of
danger
or
it
may
be
that
they
wish
for
their
own
purposes
to
scare
me
away
well
of
course
that
is
possible
also
i
am
very
much
indebted
to
you
dr
mortimer
for
introducing
me
to
a
problem
which
presents
several
interesting
alternatives
but
the
practical
point
which
we
now
have
to
decide
sir
henry
is
whether
it
is
or
is
not
advisable
for
you
to
go
to
baskerville
hall
why
should
i
not
go
there
seems
to
be
danger
do
you
mean
danger
from
this
family
fiend
or
do
you
mean
danger
from
human
beings
well
that
is
what
we
have
to
find
out
whichever
it
is
my
answer
is
fixed
there
is
no
devil
in
hell
mr
holmes
and
there
is
no
man
upon
earth
who
can
prevent
me
from
going
to
the
home
of
my
own
people
and
you
may
take
that
to
be
my
final
answer
his
dark
brows
knitted
and
his
face
flushed
to
a
dusky
red
as
he
spoke
it
was
evident
that
the
fiery
temper
of
the
baskervilles
was
not
extinct
in
this
their
last
representative
meanwhile
said
he
i
have
hardly
had
time
to
think
over
all
that
you
have
told
me
its
a
big
thing
for
a
man
to
have
to
understand
and
to
decide
at
one
sitting
i
should
like
to
have
a
quiet
hour
by
myself
to
make
up
my
mind
now
look
here
mr
holmes
its
half
past
eleven
now
and
i
am
going
back
right
away
to
my
hotel
suppose
you
and
your
friend
dr
watson
come
round
and
lunch
with
us
at
two
ill
be
able
to
tell
you
more
clearly
then
how
this
thing
strikes
me
is
that
convenient
to
you
watson
perfectly
then
you
may
expect
us
shall
i
have
a
cab
called
id
prefer
to
walk
for
this
affair
has
flurried
me
rather
ill
join
you
in
a
walk
with
pleasure
said
his
companion
then
we
meet
again
at
two
oclock
au
revoir
and
good
morning
we
heard
the
steps
of
our
visitors
descend
the
stair
and
the
bang
of
the
front
door
in
an
instant
holmes
had
changed
from
the
languid
dreamer
to
the
man
of
action
your
hat
and
boots
watson
quick
not
a
moment
to
lose
he
rushed
into
his
room
in
his
dressing
gown
and
was
back
again
in
a
few
seconds
in
a
frock
coat
we
hurried
together
down
the
stairs
and
into
the
street
dr
mortimer
and
baskerville
were
still
visible
about
two
hundred
yards
ahead
of
us
in
the
direction
of
oxford
street
shall
i
run
on
and
stop
them
not
for
the
world
my
dear
watson
i
am
perfectly
satisfied
with
your
company
if
you
will
tolerate
mine
our
friends
are
wise
for
it
is
certainly
a
very
fine
morning
for
a
walk
he
quickened
his
pace
until
we
had
decreased
the
distance
which
divided
us
by
about
half
then
still
keeping
a
hundred
yards
behind
we
followed
into
oxford
street
and
so
down
regent
street
once
our
friends
stopped
and
stared
into
a
shop
window
upon
which
holmes
did
the
same
an
instant
afterwards
he
gave
a
little
cry
of
satisfaction
and
following
the
direction
of
his
eager
eyes
i
saw
that
a
hansom
cab
with
a
man
inside
which
had
halted
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
was
now
proceeding
slowly
onward
again
theres
our
man
watson
come
along
well
have
a
good
look
at
him
if
we
can
do
no
more
at
that
instant
i
was
aware
of
a
bushy
black
beard
and
a
pair
of
piercing
eyes
turned
upon
us
through
the
side
window
of
the
cab
instantly
the
trapdoor
at
the
top
flew
up
something
was
screamed
to
the
driver
and
the
cab
flew
madly
off
down
regent
street
holmes
looked
eagerly
round
for
another
but
no
empty
one
was
in
sight
then
he
dashed
in
wild
pursuit
amid
the
stream
of
the
traffic
but
the
start
was
too
great
and
already
the
cab
was
out
of
sight
there
now
said
holmes
bitterly
as
he
emerged
panting
and
white
with
vexation
from
the
tide
of
vehicles
was
ever
such
bad
luck
and
such
bad
management
too
watson
watson
if
you
are
an
honest
man
you
will
record
this
also
and
set
it
against
my
successes
who
was
the
man
i
have
not
an
idea
a
spy
well
it
was
evident
from
what
we
have
heard
that
baskerville
has
been
very
closely
shadowed
by
someone
since
he
has
been
in
town
how
else
could
it
be
known
so
quickly
that
it
was
the
northumberland
hotel
which
he
had
chosen
if
they
had
followed
him
the
first
day
i
argued
that
they
would
follow
him
also
the
second
you
may
have
observed
that
i
twice
strolled
over
to
the
window
while
dr
mortimer
was
reading
his
legend
yes
i
remember
i
was
looking
out
for
loiterers
in
the
street
but
i
saw
none
we
are
dealing
with
a
clever
man
watson
this
matter
cuts
very
deep
and
though
i
have
not
finally
made
up
my
mind
whether
it
is
a
benevolent
or
a
malevolent
agency
which
is
in
touch
with
us
i
am
conscious
always
of
power
and
design
when
our
friends
left
i
at
once
followed
them
in
the
hopes
of
marking
down
their
invisible
attendant
so
wily
was
he
that
he
had
not
trusted
himself
upon
foot
but
he
had
availed
himself
of
a
cab
so
that
he
could
loiter
behind
or
dash
past
them
and
so
escape
their
notice
his
method
had
the
additional
advantage
that
if
they
were
to
take
a
cab
he
was
all
ready
to
follow
them
it
has
however
one
obvious
disadvantage
it
puts
him
in
the
power
of
the
cabman
exactly
what
a
pity
we
did
not
get
the
number
my
dear
watson
clumsy
as
i
have
been
you
surely
do
not
seriously
imagine
that
i
neglected
to
get
the
number
no
is
our
man
but
that
is
no
use
to
us
for
the
moment
i
fail
to
see
how
you
could
have
done
more
on
observing
the
cab
i
should
have
instantly
turned
and
walked
in
the
other
direction
i
should
then
at
my
leisure
have
hired
a
second
cab
and
followed
the
first
at
a
respectful
distance
or
better
still
have
driven
to
the
northumberland
hotel
and
waited
there
when
our
unknown
had
followed
baskerville
home
we
should
have
had
the
opportunity
of
playing
his
own
game
upon
himself
and
seeing
where
he
made
for
as
it
is
by
an
indiscreet
eagerness
which
was
taken
advantage
of
with
extraordinary
quickness
and
energy
by
our
opponent
we
have
betrayed
ourselves
and
lost
our
man
we
had
been
sauntering
slowly
down
regent
street
during
this
conversation
and
dr
mortimer
with
his
companion
had
long
vanished
in
front
of
us
there
is
no
object
in
our
following
them
said
holmes
the
shadow
has
departed
and
will
not
return
we
must
see
what
further
cards
we
have
in
our
hands
and
play
them
with
decision
could
you
swear
to
that
man
face
within
the
cab
i
could
swear
only
to
the
beard
and
so
could
i
from
which
i
gather
that
in
all
probability
it
was
a
false
one
a
clever
man
upon
so
delicate
an
errand
has
no
use
for
a
beard
save
to
conceal
his
features
come
in
here
watson
he
turned
into
one
of
the
district
messenger
offices
where
he
was
warmly
greeted
by
the
manager
ah
wilson
i
see
you
have
not
forgotten
the
little
case
in
which
i
had
the
good
fortune
to
help
you
no
sir
indeed
i
have
not
you
saved
my
good
name
and
perhaps
my
life
my
dear
fellow
you
exaggerate
i
have
some
recollection
wilson
that
you
had
among
your
boys
a
lad
named
cartwright
who
showed
some
ability
during
the
investigation
yes
sir
he
is
still
with
us
could
you
ring
him
up
thank
you
and
i
should
be
glad
to
have
change
of
this
five
pound
note
a
lad
of
fourteen
with
a
bright
keen
face
had
obeyed
the
summons
of
the
manager
he
stood
now
gazing
with
great
reverence
at
the
famous
detective
let
me
have
the
hotel
directory
said
holmes
thank
you
now
cartwright
there
are
the
names
of
twenty
three
hotels
here
all
in
the
immediate
neighbourhood
of
charing
cross
do
you
see
yes
sir
you
will
visit
each
of
these
in
turn
yes
sir
you
will
begin
in
each
case
by
giving
the
outside
porter
one
shilling
here
are
twenty
three
shillings
yes
sir
you
will
tell
him
that
you
want
to
see
the
waste
paper
of
yesterday
you
will
say
that
an
important
telegram
has
miscarried
and
that
you
are
looking
for
it
you
understand
yes
sir
but
what
you
are
really
looking
for
is
the
centre
page
of
the
times
with
some
holes
cut
in
it
with
scissors
here
is
a
copy
of
the
times
it
is
this
page
you
could
easily
recognize
it
could
you
not
yes
sir
in
each
case
the
outside
porter
will
send
for
the
hall
porter
to
whom
also
you
will
give
a
shilling
here
are
twenty
three
shillings
you
will
then
learn
in
possibly
twenty
cases
out
of
the
twenty
three
that
the
waste
of
the
day
before
has
been
burned
or
removed
in
the
three
other
cases
you
will
be
shown
a
heap
of
paper
and
you
will
look
for
this
page
of
the
times
among
it
the
odds
are
enormously
against
your
finding
it
there
are
ten
shillings
over
in
case
of
emergencies
let
me
have
a
report
by
wire
at
baker
street
before
evening
and
now
watson
it
only
remains
for
us
to
find
out
by
wire
the
identity
of
the
cabman
no
and
then
we
will
drop
into
one
of
the
bond
street
picture
galleries
and
fill
in
the
time
until
we
are
due
at
the
hotel
chapter
three
broken
threads
sherlock
holmes
had
in
a
very
remarkable
degree
the
power
of
detaching
his
mind
at
will
for
two
hours
the
strange
business
in
which
we
had
been
involved
appeared
to
be
forgotten
and
he
was
entirely
absorbed
in
the
pictures
of
the
modern
belgian
masters
he
would
talk
of
nothing
but
art
of
which
he
had
the
crudest
ideas
from
our
leaving
the
gallery
until
we
found
ourselves
at
the
northumberland
hotel
sir
henry
baskerville
is
upstairs
expecting
you
said
the
clerk
he
asked
me
to
show
you
up
at
once
when
you
came
have
you
any
objection
to
my
looking
at
your
register
said
holmes
not
in
the
least
the
book
showed
that
two
names
had
been
added
after
that
of
baskerville
one
was
theophilus
johnson
and
family
of
newcastle
the
other
mrs
oldmore
and
maid
of
high
lodge
alton
surely
that
must
be
the
same
johnson
whom
i
used
to
know
said
holmes
to
the
porter
a
lawyer
is
he
not
gray
headed
and
walks
with
a
limp
no
sir
this
is
mr
johnson
the
coal
owner
a
very
active
gentleman
not
older
than
yourself
surely
you
are
mistaken
about
his
trade
no
sir
he
has
used
this
hotel
for
many
years
and
he
is
very
well
known
to
us
ah
that
settles
it
mrs
oldmore
too
i
seem
to
remember
the
name
excuse
my
curiosity
but
often
in
calling
upon
one
friend
one
finds
another
she
is
an
invalid
lady
sir
her
husband
was
once
mayor
of
gloucester
she
always
comes
to
us
when
she
is
in
town
thank
you
i
am
afraid
i
cannot
claim
her
acquaintance
we
have
established
a
most
important
fact
by
these
questions
watson
he
continued
in
a
low
voice
as
we
went
upstairs
together
we
know
now
that
the
people
who
are
so
interested
in
our
friend
have
not
settled
down
in
his
own
hotel
that
means
that
while
they
are
as
we
have
seen
very
anxious
to
watch
him
they
are
equally
anxious
that
he
should
not
see
them
now
this
is
a
most
suggestive
fact
what
does
it
suggest
it
suggests
halloa
my
dear
fellow
what
on
earth
is
the
matter
as
we
came
round
the
top
of
the
stairs
we
had
run
up
against
sir
henry
baskerville
himself
his
face
was
flushed
with
anger
and
he
held
an
old
and
dusty
boot
in
one
of
his
hands
so
furious
was
he
that
he
was
hardly
articulate
and
when
he
did
speak
it
was
in
a
much
broader
and
more
western
dialect
than
any
which
we
had
heard
from
him
in
the
morning
seems
to
me
they
are
playing
me
for
a
sucker
in
this
hotel
he
cried
theyll
find
theyve
started
in
to
monkey
with
the
wrong
man
unless
they
are
careful
by
thunder
if
that
chap
cant
find
my
missing
boot
there
will
be
trouble
i
can
take
a
joke
with
the
best
mr
holmes
but
theyve
got
a
bit
over
the
mark
this
time
still
looking
for
your
boot
yes
sir
and
mean
to
find
it
but
surely
you
said
that
it
was
a
new
brown
boot
so
it
was
sir
and
now
its
an
old
black
one
what
you
dont
mean
to
say
thats
just
what
i
do
mean
to
say
i
only
had
three
pairs
in
the
world
the
new
brown
the
old
black
and
the
patent
leathers
which
i
am
wearing
last
night
they
took
one
of
my
brown
ones
and
today
they
have
sneaked
one
of
the
black
well
have
you
got
it
speak
out
man
and
dont
stand
staring
an
agitated
german
waiter
had
appeared
upon
the
scene
no
sir
i
have
made
inquiry
all
over
the
hotel
but
i
can
hear
no
word
of
it
well
either
that
boot
comes
back
before
sundown
or
ill
see
the
manager
and
tell
him
that
i
go
right
straight
out
of
this
hotel
it
shall
be
found
sir
i
promise
you
that
if
you
will
have
a
little
patience
it
will
be
found
mind
it
is
for
its
the
last
thing
of
mine
that
ill
lose
in
this
den
of
thieves
well
well
mr
holmes
youll
excuse
my
troubling
you
about
such
a
trifle
i
think
its
well
worth
troubling
about
why
you
look
very
serious
over
it
how
do
you
explain
it
i
just
dont
attempt
to
explain
it
it
seems
the
very
maddest
queerest
thing
that
ever
happened
to
me
the
queerest
perhaps
said
holmes
thoughtfully
what
do
you
make
of
it
yourself
well
i
dont
profess
to
understand
it
yet
this
case
of
yours
is
very
complex
sir
henry
when
taken
in
conjunction
with
your
uncles
death
i
am
not
sure
that
of
all
the
five
hundred
cases
of
capital
importance
which
i
have
handled
there
is
one
which
cuts
so
deep
but
we
hold
several
threads
in
our
hands
and
the
odds
are
that
one
or
other
of
them
guides
us
to
the
truth
we
may
waste
time
in
following
the
wrong
one
but
sooner
or
later
we
must
come
upon
the
right
we
had
a
pleasant
luncheon
in
which
little
was
said
of
the
business
which
had
brought
us
together
it
was
in
the
private
sitting
room
to
which
we
afterwards
repaired
that
holmes
asked
baskerville
what
were
his
intentions
to
go
to
baskerville
hall
and
when
at
the
end
of
the
week
on
the
whole
said
holmes
i
think
that
your
decision
is
a
wise
one
i
have
ample
evidence
that
you
are
being
dogged
in
london
and
amid
the
millions
of
this
great
city
it
is
difficult
to
discover
who
these
people
are
or
what
their
object
can
be
if
their
intentions
are
evil
they
might
do
you
a
mischief
and
we
should
be
powerless
to
prevent
it
you
did
not
know
dr
mortimer
that
you
were
followed
this
morning
from
my
house
dr
mortimer
started
violently
followed
by
whom
that
unfortunately
is
what
i
cannot
tell
you
have
you
among
your
neighbours
or
acquaintances
on
dartmoor
any
man
with
a
black
full
beard
no
or
let
me
see
why
yes
barrymore
sir
charless
butler
is
a
man
with
a
full
black
beard
ha
where
is
barrymore
he
is
in
charge
of
the
hall
we
had
best
ascertain
if
he
is
really
there
or
if
by
any
possibility
he
might
be
in
london
how
can
you
do
that
give
me
a
telegraph
form
is
all
ready
for
sir
henry
that
will
do
address
to
mr
barrymore
baskerville
hall
what
is
the
nearest
telegraph
office
grimpen
very
good
we
will
send
a
second
wire
to
the
postmaster
grimpen
telegram
to
mr
barrymore
to
be
delivered
into
his
own
hand
if
absent
please
return
wire
to
sir
henry
baskerville
northumberland
hotel
that
should
let
us
know
before
evening
whether
barrymore
is
at
his
post
in
devonshire
or
not
thats
so
said
baskerville
by
the
way
dr
mortimer
who
is
this
barrymore
anyhow
he
is
the
son
of
the
old
caretaker
who
is
dead
they
have
looked
after
the
hall
for
four
generations
now
so
far
as
i
know
he
and
his
wife
are
as
respectable
a
couple
as
any
in
the
county
at
the
same
time
said
baskerville
its
clear
enough
that
so
long
as
there
are
none
of
the
family
at
the
hall
these
people
have
a
mighty
fine
home
and
nothing
to
do
that
is
true
did
barrymore
profit
at
all
by
sir
charless
will
asked
holmes
he
and
his
wife
had
five
hundred
pounds
each
ha
did
they
know
that
they
would
receive
this
yes
sir
charles
was
very
fond
of
talking
about
the
provisions
of
his
will
that
is
very
interesting
i
hope
said
dr
mortimer
that
you
do
not
look
with
suspicious
eyes
upon
everyone
who
received
a
legacy
from
sir
charles
for
i
also
had
a
thousand
pounds
left
to
me
indeed
and
anyone
else
there
were
many
insignificant
sums
to
individuals
and
a
large
number
of
public
charities
the
residue
all
went
to
sir
henry
and
how
much
was
the
residue
seven
hundred
and
forty
thousand
pounds
holmes
raised
his
eyebrows
in
surprise
i
had
no
idea
that
so
gigantic
a
sum
was
involved
said
he
sir
charles
had
the
reputation
of
being
rich
but
we
did
not
know
how
very
rich
he
was
until
we
came
to
examine
his
securities
the
total
value
of
the
estate
was
close
on
to
a
million
dear
me
it
is
a
stake
for
which
a
man
might
well
play
a
desperate
game
and
one
more
question
dr
mortimer
supposing
that
anything
happened
to
our
young
friend
here
you
will
forgive
the
unpleasant
hypothesis
who
would
inherit
the
estate
since
rodger
baskerville
sir
charless
younger
brother
died
unmarried
the
estate
would
descend
to
the
desmonds
who
are
distant
cousins
james
desmond
is
an
elderly
clergyman
in
westmoreland
thank
you
these
details
are
all
of
great
interest
have
you
met
mr
james
desmond
yes
he
once
came
down
to
visit
sir
charles
he
is
a
man
of
venerable
appearance
and
of
saintly
life
i
remember
that
he
refused
to
accept
any
settlement
from
sir
charles
though
he
pressed
it
upon
him
and
this
man
of
simple
tastes
would
be
the
heir
to
sir
charles
thousands
he
would
be
the
heir
to
the
estate
because
that
is
entailed
he
would
also
be
the
heir
to
the
money
unless
it
were
willed
otherwise
by
the
present
owner
who
can
of
course
do
what
he
likes
with
it
and
have
you
made
your
will
sir
henry
no
mr
holmes
i
have
not
ive
had
no
time
for
it
was
only
yesterday
that
i
learned
how
matters
stood
but
in
any
case
i
feel
that
the
money
should
go
with
the
title
and
estate
that
was
my
poor
uncles
idea
how
is
the
owner
going
to
restore
the
glories
of
the
baskervilles
if
he
has
not
money
enough
to
keep
up
the
property
house
land
and
dollars
must
go
together
quite
so
well
sir
henry
i
am
of
one
mind
with
you
as
to
the
advisability
of
your
going
down
to
devonshire
without
delay
there
is
only
one
provision
which
i
must
make
you
certainly
must
not
go
alone
dr
mortimer
returns
with
me
but
dr
mortimer
has
his
practice
to
attend
to
and
his
house
is
miles
away
from
yours
with
all
the
goodwill
in
the
world
he
may
be
unable
to
help
you
no
sir
henry
you
must
take
with
you
someone
a
trusty
man
who
will
be
always
by
your
side
is
it
possible
that
you
could
come
yourself
mr
holmes
if
matters
came
to
a
crisis
i
should
endeavour
to
be
present
in
person
but
you
can
understand
that
with
my
extensive
consulting
practice
and
with
the
constant
appeals
which
reach
me
from
many
quarters
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
be
absent
from
london
for
an
indefinite
time
at
the
present
instant
one
of
the
most
revered
names
in
england
is
being
besmirched
by
a
blackmailer
and
only
i
can
stop
a
disastrous
scandal
you
will
see
how
impossible
it
is
for
me
to
go
to
dartmoor
whom
would
you
recommend
then
holmes
laid
his
hand
upon
my
arm
if
my
friend
would
undertake
it
there
is
no
man
who
is
better
worth
having
at
your
side
when
you
are
in
a
tight
place
no
one
can
say
so
more
confidently
than
i
the
proposition
took
me
completely
by
surprise
but
before
i
had
time
to
answer
baskerville
seized
me
by
the
hand
and
wrung
it
heartily
well
now
that
is
real
kind
of
you
dr
watson
said
he
you
see
how
it
is
with
me
and
you
know
just
as
much
about
the
matter
as
i
do
if
you
will
come
down
to
baskerville
hall
and
see
me
through
ill
never
forget
it
the
promise
of
adventure
had
always
a
fascination
for
me
and
i
was
complimented
by
the
words
of
holmes
and
by
the
eagerness
with
which
the
baronet
hailed
me
as
a
companion
i
will
come
with
pleasure
said
i
i
do
not
know
how
i
could
employ
my
time
better
and
you
will
report
very
carefully
to
me
said
holmes
when
a
crisis
comes
as
it
will
do
i
will
direct
how
you
shall
act
i
suppose
that
by
saturday
all
might
be
ready
would
that
suit
dr
watson
perfectly
then
on
saturday
unless
you
hear
to
the
contrary
we
shall
meet
at
the
ten
thirty
train
from
paddington
we
had
risen
to
depart
when
baskerville
gave
a
cry
of
triumph
and
diving
into
one
of
the
corners
of
the
room
he
drew
a
brown
boot
from
under
a
cabinet
my
missing
boot
he
cried
may
all
our
difficulties
vanish
as
easily
said
sherlock
holmes
but
it
is
a
very
singular
thing
dr
mortimer
remarked
i
searched
this
room
carefully
before
lunch
and
so
did
i
said
baskerville
every
inch
of
it
there
was
certainly
no
boot
in
it
then
in
that
case
the
waiter
must
have
placed
it
there
while
we
were
lunching
the
german
was
sent
for
but
professed
to
know
nothing
of
the
matter
nor
could
any
inquiry
clear
it
up
another
item
had
been
added
to
that
constant
and
apparently
purposeless
series
of
small
mysteries
which
had
succeeded
each
other
so
rapidly
setting
aside
the
whole
grim
story
of
sir
charless
death
we
had
a
line
of
inexplicable
incidents
all
within
the
limits
of
two
days
which
included
the
receipt
of
the
printed
letter
the
black
bearded
spy
in
the
hansom
the
loss
of
the
new
brown
boot
the
loss
of
the
old
black
boot
and
now
the
return
of
the
new
brown
boot
holmes
sat
in
silence
in
the
cab
as
we
drove
back
to
baker
street
and
i
knew
from
his
drawn
brows
and
keen
face
that
his
mind
like
my
own
was
busy
in
endeavouring
to
frame
some
scheme
into
which
all
these
strange
and
apparently
disconnected
episodes
could
be
fitted
all
afternoon
and
late
into
the
evening
he
sat
lost
in
tobacco
and
thought
just
before
dinner
two
telegrams
were
handed
in
the
first
ran
have
just
heard
that
barrymore
is
at
the
hall
baskerville
the
second
visited
twenty
three
hotels
as
directed
but
sorry
to
report
unable
to
trace
cut
sheet
of
times
cartwright
there
go
two
of
my
threads
watson
there
is
nothing
more
stimulating
than
a
case
where
everything
goes
against
you
we
must
cast
round
for
another
scent
we
have
still
the
cabman
who
drove
the
spy
exactly
i
have
wired
to
get
his
name
and
address
from
the
official
registry
i
should
not
be
surprised
if
this
were
an
answer
to
my
question
the
ring
at
the
bell
proved
to
be
something
even
more
satisfactory
than
an
answer
however
for
the
door
opened
and
a
rough
looking
fellow
entered
who
was
evidently
the
man
himself
i
got
a
message
from
the
head
office
that
a
gent
at
this
address
had
been
inquiring
for
no
said
he
ive
driven
my
cab
this
seven
years
and
never
a
word
of
complaint
i
came
here
straight
from
the
yard
to
ask
you
to
your
face
what
you
had
against
me
i
have
nothing
in
the
world
against
you
my
good
man
said
holmes
on
the
contrary
i
have
half
a
sovereign
for
you
if
you
will
give
me
a
clear
answer
to
my
questions
well
ive
had
a
good
day
and
no
mistake
said
the
cabman
with
a
grin
what
was
it
you
wanted
to
ask
sir
first
of
all
your
name
and
address
in
case
i
want
you
again
john
clayton
turpey
street
the
borough
my
cab
is
out
of
shipley
yard
near
waterloo
station
sherlock
holmes
made
a
note
of
it
now
clayton
tell
me
all
about
the
fare
who
came
and
watched
this
house
at
ten
oclock
this
morning
and
afterwards
followed
the
two
gentlemen
down
regent
street
the
man
looked
surprised
and
a
little
embarrassed
why
theres
no
good
my
telling
you
things
for
you
seem
to
know
as
much
as
i
do
already
said
he
the
truth
is
that
the
gentleman
told
me
that
he
was
a
detective
and
that
i
was
to
say
nothing
about
him
to
anyone
my
good
fellow
this
is
a
very
serious
business
and
you
may
find
yourself
in
a
pretty
bad
position
if
you
try
to
hide
anything
from
me
you
say
that
your
fare
told
you
that
he
was
a
detective
yes
he
did
when
did
he
say
this
when
he
left
me
did
he
say
anything
more
he
mentioned
his
name
holmes
cast
a
swift
glance
of
triumph
at
me
oh
he
mentioned
his
name
did
he
that
was
imprudent
what
was
the
name
that
he
mentioned
his
name
said
the
cabman
was
mr
sherlock
holmes
never
have
i
seen
my
friend
more
completely
taken
aback
than
by
the
cabmans
reply
for
an
instant
he
sat
in
silent
amazement
then
he
burst
into
a
hearty
laugh
a
touch
watson
an
undeniable
touch
said
he
i
feel
a
foil
as
quick
and
supple
as
my
own
he
got
home
upon
me
very
prettily
that
time
so
his
name
was
sherlock
holmes
was
it
yes
sir
that
was
the
gentlemans
name
excellent
tell
me
where
you
picked
him
up
and
all
that
occurred
he
hailed
me
at
half
past
nine
in
trafalgar
square
he
said
that
he
was
a
detective
and
he
offered
me
two
guineas
if
i
would
do
exactly
what
he
wanted
all
day
and
ask
no
questions
i
was
glad
enough
to
agree
first
we
drove
down
to
the
northumberland
hotel
and
waited
there
until
two
gentlemen
came
out
and
took
a
cab
from
the
rank
we
followed
their
cab
until
it
pulled
up
somewhere
near
here
this
very
door
said
holmes
well
i
couldnt
be
sure
of
that
but
i
dare
say
my
fare
knew
all
about
it
we
pulled
up
halfway
down
the
street
and
waited
an
hour
and
a
half
then
the
two
gentlemen
passed
us
walking
and
we
followed
down
baker
street
and
along
i
know
said
holmes
until
we
got
three
quarters
down
regent
street
then
my
gentleman
threw
up
the
trap
and
he
cried
that
i
should
drive
right
away
to
waterloo
station
as
hard
as
i
could
go
i
whipped
up
the
mare
and
we
were
there
under
the
ten
minutes
then
he
paid
up
his
two
guineas
like
a
good
one
and
away
he
went
into
the
station
only
just
as
he
was
leaving
he
turned
round
and
he
said
it
might
interest
you
to
know
that
you
have
been
driving
mr
sherlock
holmes
thats
how
i
come
to
know
the
name
i
see
and
you
saw
no
more
of
him
not
after
he
went
into
the
station
and
how
would
you
describe
mr
sherlock
holmes
the
cabman
scratched
his
head
well
he
wasnt
altogether
such
an
easy
gentleman
to
describe
id
put
him
at
forty
years
of
age
and
he
was
of
a
middle
height
two
or
three
inches
shorter
than
you
sir
he
was
dressed
like
a
toff
and
he
had
a
black
beard
cut
square
at
the
end
and
a
pale
face
i
dont
know
as
i
could
say
more
than
that
colour
of
his
eyes
no
i
cant
say
that
nothing
more
that
you
can
remember
no
sir
nothing
well
then
here
is
your
half
sovereign
theres
another
one
waiting
for
you
if
you
can
bring
any
more
information
good
night
good
night
sir
and
thank
you
john
clayton
departed
chuckling
and
holmes
turned
to
me
with
a
shrug
of
his
shoulders
and
a
rueful
smile
snap
goes
our
third
thread
and
we
end
where
we
began
said
he
the
cunning
rascal
he
knew
our
number
knew
that
sir
henry
baskerville
had
consulted
me
spotted
who
i
was
in
regent
street
conjectured
that
i
had
got
the
number
of
the
cab
and
would
lay
my
hands
on
the
driver
and
so
sent
back
this
audacious
message
i
tell
you
watson
this
time
we
have
got
a
foeman
who
is
worthy
of
our
steel
ive
been
checkmated
in
london
i
can
only
wish
you
better
luck
in
devonshire
but
im
not
easy
in
my
mind
about
it
about
what
about
sending
you
its
an
ugly
business
watson
an
ugly
dangerous
business
and
the
more
i
see
of
it
the
less
i
like
it
yes
my
dear
fellow
you
may
laugh
but
i
give
you
my
word
that
i
shall
be
very
glad
to
have
you
back
safe
and
sound
in
baker
street
once
more
chapter
baskerville
hall
sir
henry
baskerville
and
dr
mortimer
were
ready
upon
the
appointed
day
and
we
started
as
arranged
for
devonshire
mr
sherlock
holmes
drove
with
me
to
the
station
and
gave
me
his
last
parting
injunctions
and
advice
i
will
not
bias
your
mind
by
suggesting
theories
or
suspicions
watson
said
he
i
wish
you
simply
to
report
facts
in
the
fullest
possible
manner
to
me
and
you
can
leave
me
to
do
the
theorizing
what
sort
of
facts
i
asked
anything
which
may
seem
to
have
a
bearing
however
indirect
upon
the
case
and
especially
the
relations
between
young
baskerville
and
his
neighbours
or
any
fresh
particulars
concerning
the
death
of
sir
charles
i
have
made
some
inquiries
myself
in
the
last
few
days
but
the
results
have
i
fear
been
negative
one
thing
only
appears
to
be
certain
and
that
is
that
mr
james
desmond
who
is
the
next
heir
is
an
elderly
gentleman
of
a
very
amiable
disposition
so
that
this
persecution
does
not
arise
from
him
i
really
think
that
we
may
eliminate
him
entirely
from
our
calculations
there
remain
the
people
who
will
actually
surround
sir
henry
baskerville
upon
the
moor
would
it
not
be
well
in
the
first
place
to
get
rid
of
this
barrymore
couple
by
no
means
you
could
not
make
a
greater
mistake
if
they
are
innocent
it
would
be
a
cruel
injustice
and
if
they
are
guilty
we
should
be
giving
up
all
chance
of
bringing
it
home
to
them
no
no
we
will
preserve
them
upon
our
list
of
suspects
then
there
is
a
groom
at
the
hall
if
i
remember
right
there
are
two
moorland
farmers
there
is
our
friend
dr
mortimer
whom
i
believe
to
be
entirely
honest
and
there
is
his
wife
of
whom
we
know
nothing
there
is
this
naturalist
stapleton
and
there
is
his
sister
who
is
said
to
be
a
young
lady
of
attractions
there
is
mr
frankland
of
lafter
hall
who
is
also
an
unknown
factor
and
there
are
one
or
two
other
neighbours
these
are
the
folk
who
must
be
your
very
special
study
i
will
do
my
best
you
have
arms
i
suppose
yes
i
thought
it
as
well
to
take
them
most
certainly
keep
your
revolver
near
you
night
and
day
and
never
relax
your
precautions
our
friends
had
already
secured
a
first
class
carriage
and
were
waiting
for
us
upon
the
platform
no
we
have
no
news
of
any
kind
said
dr
mortimer
in
answer
to
my
friends
questions
i
can
swear
to
one
thing
and
that
is
that
we
have
not
been
shadowed
during
the
last
two
days
we
have
never
gone
out
without
keeping
a
sharp
watch
and
no
one
could
have
escaped
our
notice
you
have
always
kept
together
i
presume
except
yesterday
afternoon
i
usually
give
up
one
day
to
pure
amusement
when
i
come
to
town
so
i
spent
it
at
the
museum
of
the
college
of
surgeons
and
i
went
to
look
at
the
folk
in
the
park
said
baskerville
but
we
had
no
trouble
of
any
kind
it
was
imprudent
all
the
same
said
holmes
shaking
his
head
and
looking
very
grave
i
beg
sir
henry
that
you
will
not
go
about
alone
some
great
misfortune
will
befall
you
if
you
do
did
you
get
your
other
boot
no
sir
it
is
gone
forever
indeed
that
is
very
interesting
well
good
bye
he
added
as
the
train
began
to
glide
down
the
platform
bear
in
mind
sir
henry
one
of
the
phrases
in
that
queer
old
legend
which
dr
mortimer
has
read
to
us
and
avoid
the
moor
in
those
hours
of
darkness
when
the
powers
of
evil
are
exalted
i
looked
back
at
the
platform
when
we
had
left
it
far
behind
and
saw
the
tall
austere
figure
of
holmes
standing
motionless
and
gazing
after
us
the
journey
was
a
swift
and
pleasant
one
and
i
spent
it
in
making
the
more
intimate
acquaintance
of
my
two
companions
and
in
playing
with
dr
mortimers
spaniel
in
a
very
few
hours
the
brown
earth
had
become
ruddy
the
brick
had
changed
to
granite
and
red
cows
grazed
in
well
hedged
fields
where
the
lush
grasses
and
more
luxuriant
vegetation
spoke
of
a
richer
if
a
damper
climate
young
baskerville
stared
eagerly
out
of
the
window
and
cried
aloud
with
delight
as
he
recognized
the
familiar
features
of
the
devon
scenery
ive
been
over
a
good
part
of
the
world
since
i
left
it
dr
watson
said
he
but
i
have
never
seen
a
place
to
compare
with
it
i
never
saw
a
devonshire
man
who
did
not
swear
by
his
county
i
remarked
it
depends
upon
the
breed
of
men
quite
as
much
as
on
the
county
said
dr
mortimer
a
glance
at
our
friend
here
reveals
the
rounded
head
of
the
celt
which
carries
inside
it
the
celtic
enthusiasm
and
power
of
attachment
poor
sir
charless
head
was
of
a
very
rare
type
half
gaelic
half
ivernian
in
its
characteristics
but
you
were
very
young
when
you
last
saw
baskerville
hall
were
you
not
i
was
a
boy
in
my
teens
at
the
time
of
my
fathers
death
and
had
never
seen
the
hall
for
he
lived
in
a
little
cottage
on
the
south
coast
thence
i
went
straight
to
a
friend
in
america
i
tell
you
it
is
all
as
new
to
me
as
it
is
to
dr
watson
and
im
as
keen
as
possible
to
see
the
moor
are
you
then
your
wish
is
easily
granted
for
there
is
your
first
sight
of
the
moor
said
dr
mortimer
pointing
out
of
the
carriage
window
over
the
green
squares
of
the
fields
and
the
low
curve
of
a
wood
there
rose
in
the
distance
a
gray
melancholy
hill
with
a
strange
jagged
summit
dim
and
vague
in
the
distance
like
some
fantastic
landscape
in
a
dream
baskerville
sat
for
a
long
time
his
eyes
fixed
upon
it
and
i
read
upon
his
eager
face
how
much
it
meant
to
him
this
first
sight
of
that
strange
spot
where
the
men
of
his
blood
had
held
sway
so
long
and
left
their
mark
so
deep
there
he
sat
with
his
tweed
suit
and
his
american
accent
in
the
corner
of
a
prosaic
railway
carriage
and
yet
as
i
looked
at
his
dark
and
expressive
face
i
felt
more
than
ever
how
true
a
descendant
he
was
of
that
long
line
of
high
blooded
fiery
and
masterful
men
there
were
pride
valour
and
strength
in
his
thick
brows
his
sensitive
nostrils
and
his
large
hazel
eyes
if
on
that
forbidding
moor
a
difficult
and
dangerous
quest
should
lie
before
us
this
was
at
least
a
comrade
for
whom
one
might
venture
to
take
a
risk
with
the
certainty
that
he
would
bravely
share
it
the
train
pulled
up
at
a
small
wayside
station
and
we
all
descended
outside
beyond
the
low
white
fence
a
wagonette
with
a
pair
of
cobs
was
waiting
our
coming
was
evidently
a
great
event
for
station
master
and
porters
clustered
round
us
to
carry
out
our
luggage
it
was
a
sweet
simple
country
spot
but
i
was
surprised
to
observe
that
by
the
gate
there
stood
two
soldierly
men
in
dark
uniforms
who
leaned
upon
their
short
rifles
and
glanced
keenly
at
us
as
we
passed
the
coachman
a
hard
faced
gnarled
little
fellow
saluted
sir
henry
baskerville
and
in
a
few
minutes
we
were
flying
swiftly
down
the
broad
white
road
rolling
pasture
lands
curved
upward
on
either
side
of
us
and
old
gabled
houses
peeped
out
from
amid
the
thick
green
foliage
but
behind
the
peaceful
and
sunlit
countryside
there
rose
ever
dark
against
the
evening
sky
the
long
gloomy
curve
of
the
moor
broken
by
the
jagged
and
sinister
hills
the
wagonette
swung
round
into
a
side
road
and
we
curved
upward
through
deep
lanes
worn
by
centuries
of
wheels
high
banks
on
either
side
heavy
with
dripping
moss
and
fleshy
harts
tongue
ferns
bronzing
bracken
and
mottled
bramble
gleamed
in
the
light
of
the
sinking
sun
still
steadily
rising
we
passed
over
a
narrow
granite
bridge
and
skirted
a
noisy
stream
which
gushed
swiftly
down
foaming
and
roaring
amid
the
gray
boulders
both
road
and
stream
wound
up
through
a
valley
dense
with
scrub
oak
and
fir
at
every
turn
baskerville
gave
an
exclamation
of
delight
looking
eagerly
about
him
and
asking
countless
questions
to
his
eyes
all
seemed
beautiful
but
to
me
a
tinge
of
melancholy
lay
upon
the
countryside
which
bore
so
clearly
the
mark
of
the
waning
year
yellow
leaves
carpeted
the
lanes
and
fluttered
down
upon
us
as
we
passed
the
rattle
of
our
wheels
died
away
as
we
drove
through
drifts
of
rotting
vegetation
sad
gifts
as
it
seemed
to
me
for
nature
to
throw
before
the
carriage
of
the
returning
heir
of
the
baskervilles
halloa
cried
dr
mortimer
what
is
this
a
steep
curve
of
heath
clad
land
an
outlying
spur
of
the
moor
lay
in
front
of
us
on
the
summit
hard
and
clear
like
an
equestrian
statue
upon
its
pedestal
was
a
mounted
soldier
dark
and
stern
his
rifle
poised
ready
over
his
forearm
he
was
watching
the
road
along
which
we
travelled
what
is
this
perkins
asked
dr
mortimer
our
driver
half
turned
in
his
seat
theres
a
convict
escaped
from
princetown
sir
hes
been
out
three
days
now
and
the
warders
watch
every
road
and
every
station
but
theyve
had
no
sight
of
him
yet
the
farmers
about
here
dont
like
it
sir
and
thats
a
fact
well
i
understand
that
they
get
five
pounds
if
they
can
give
information
yes
sir
but
the
chance
of
five
pounds
is
but
a
poor
thing
compared
to
the
chance
of
having
your
throat
cut
you
see
it
isnt
like
any
ordinary
convict
this
is
a
man
that
would
stick
at
nothing
who
is
he
then
it
is
selden
the
notting
hill
murderer
i
remembered
the
case
well
for
it
was
one
in
which
holmes
had
taken
an
interest
on
account
of
the
peculiar
ferocity
of
the
crime
and
the
wanton
brutality
which
had
marked
all
the
actions
of
the
assassin
the
commutation
of
his
death
sentence
had
been
due
to
some
doubts
as
to
his
complete
sanity
so
atrocious
was
his
conduct
our
wagonette
had
topped
a
rise
and
in
front
of
us
rose
the
huge
expanse
of
the
moor
mottled
with
gnarled
and
craggy
cairns
and
tors
a
cold
wind
swept
down
from
it
and
set
us
shivering
somewhere
there
on
that
desolate
plain
was
lurking
this
fiendish
man
hiding
in
a
burrow
like
a
wild
beast
his
heart
full
of
malignancy
against
the
whole
race
which
had
cast
him
out
it
needed
but
this
to
complete
the
grim
suggestiveness
of
the
barren
waste
the
chilling
wind
and
the
darkling
sky
even
baskerville
fell
silent
and
pulled
his
overcoat
more
closely
around
him
we
had
left
the
fertile
country
behind
and
beneath
us
we
looked
back
on
it
now
the
slanting
rays
of
a
low
sun
turning
the
streams
to
threads
of
gold
and
glowing
on
the
red
earth
new
turned
by
the
plough
and
the
broad
tangle
of
the
woodlands
the
road
in
front
of
us
grew
bleaker
and
wilder
over
huge
russet
and
olive
slopes
sprinkled
with
giant
boulders
now
and
then
we
passed
a
moorland
cottage
walled
and
roofed
with
stone
with
no
creeper
to
break
its
harsh
outline
suddenly
we
looked
down
into
a
cuplike
depression
patched
with
stunted
oaks
and
firs
which
had
been
twisted
and
bent
by
the
fury
of
years
of
storm
two
high
narrow
towers
rose
over
the
trees
the
driver
pointed
with
his
whip
baskerville
hall
said
he
its
master
had
risen
and
was
staring
with
flushed
cheeks
and
shining
eyes
a
few
minutes
later
we
had
reached
the
lodge
gates
a
maze
of
fantastic
tracery
in
wrought
iron
with
weather
bitten
pillars
on
either
side
blotched
with
lichens
and
surmounted
by
the
boars
heads
of
the
baskervilles
the
lodge
was
a
ruin
of
black
granite
and
bared
ribs
of
rafters
but
facing
it
was
a
new
building
half
constructed
the
first
fruit
of
sir
charless
south
african
gold
through
the
gateway
we
passed
into
the
avenue
where
the
wheels
were
again
hushed
amid
the
leaves
and
the
old
trees
shot
their
branches
in
a
sombre
tunnel
over
our
heads
baskerville
shuddered
as
he
looked
up
the
long
dark
drive
to
where
the
house
glimmered
like
a
ghost
at
the
farther
end
was
it
here
he
asked
in
a
low
voice
no
no
the
yew
alley
is
on
the
other
side
the
young
heir
glanced
round
with
a
gloomy
face
its
no
wonder
my
uncle
felt
as
if
trouble
were
coming
on
him
in
such
a
place
as
this
said
he
its
enough
to
scare
any
man
ill
have
a
row
of
electric
lamps
up
here
inside
of
six
months
and
you
wont
know
it
again
with
a
thousand
candle
power
swan
and
edison
right
here
in
front
of
the
hall
door
the
avenue
opened
into
a
broad
expanse
of
turf
and
the
house
lay
before
us
in
the
fading
light
i
could
see
that
the
centre
was
a
heavy
block
of
building
from
which
a
porch
projected
the
whole
front
was
draped
in
ivy
with
a
patch
clipped
bare
here
and
there
where
a
window
or
a
coat
of
arms
broke
through
the
dark
veil
from
this
central
block
rose
the
twin
towers
ancient
crenelated
and
pierced
with
many
loopholes
to
right
and
left
of
the
turrets
were
more
modern
wings
of
black
granite
a
dull
light
shone
through
heavy
mullioned
windows
and
from
the
high
chimneys
which
rose
from
the
steep
high
angled
roof
there
sprang
a
single
black
column
of
smoke
welcome
sir
henry
welcome
to
baskerville
hall
a
tall
man
had
stepped
from
the
shadow
of
the
porch
to
open
the
door
of
the
wagonette
the
figure
of
a
woman
was
silhouetted
against
the
yellow
light
of
the
hall
she
came
out
and
helped
the
man
to
hand
down
our
bags
you
dont
mind
my
driving
straight
home
sir
henry
said
dr
mortimer
my
wife
is
expecting
me
surely
you
will
stay
and
have
some
dinner
no
i
must
go
i
shall
probably
find
some
work
awaiting
me
i
would
stay
to
show
you
over
the
house
but
barrymore
will
be
a
better
guide
than
i
good
bye
and
never
hesitate
night
or
day
to
send
for
me
if
i
can
be
of
service
the
wheels
died
away
down
the
drive
while
sir
henry
and
i
turned
into
the
hall
and
the
door
clanged
heavily
behind
us
it
was
a
fine
apartment
in
which
we
found
ourselves
large
lofty
and
heavily
raftered
with
huge
baulks
of
age
blackened
oak
in
the
great
old
fashioned
fireplace
behind
the
high
iron
dogs
a
log
fire
crackled
and
snapped
sir
henry
and
i
held
out
our
hands
to
it
for
we
were
numb
from
our
long
drive
then
we
gazed
round
us
at
the
high
thin
window
of
old
stained
glass
the
oak
panelling
the
stags
heads
the
coats
of
arms
upon
the
walls
all
dim
and
sombre
in
the
subdued
light
of
the
central
lamp
its
just
as
i
imagined
it
said
sir
henry
is
it
not
the
very
picture
of
an
old
family
home
to
think
that
this
should
be
the
same
hall
in
which
for
five
hundred
years
my
people
have
lived
it
strikes
me
solemn
to
think
of
it
i
saw
his
dark
face
lit
up
with
a
boyish
enthusiasm
as
he
gazed
about
him
the
light
beat
upon
him
where
he
stood
but
long
shadows
trailed
down
the
walls
and
hung
like
a
black
canopy
above
him
barrymore
had
returned
from
taking
our
luggage
to
our
rooms
he
stood
in
front
of
us
now
with
the
subdued
manner
of
a
well
trained
servant
he
was
a
remarkable
looking
man
tall
handsome
with
a
square
black
beard
and
pale
distinguished
features
would
you
wish
dinner
to
be
served
at
once
sir
is
it
ready
in
a
very
few
minutes
sir
you
will
find
hot
water
in
your
rooms
my
wife
and
i
will
be
happy
sir
henry
to
stay
with
you
until
you
have
made
your
fresh
arrangements
but
you
will
understand
that
under
the
new
conditions
this
house
will
require
a
considerable
staff
what
new
conditions
i
only
meant
sir
that
sir
charles
led
a
very
retired
life
and
we
were
able
to
look
after
his
wants
you
would
naturally
wish
to
have
more
company
and
so
you
will
need
changes
in
your
household
do
you
mean
that
your
wife
and
you
wish
to
leave
only
when
it
is
quite
convenient
to
you
sir
but
your
family
have
been
with
us
for
several
generations
have
they
not
i
should
be
sorry
to
begin
my
life
here
by
breaking
an
old
family
connection
i
seemed
to
discern
some
signs
of
emotion
upon
the
butlers
white
face
i
feel
that
also
sir
and
so
does
my
wife
but
to
tell
the
truth
sir
we
were
both
very
much
attached
to
sir
charles
and
his
death
gave
us
a
shock
and
made
these
surroundings
very
painful
to
us
i
fear
that
we
shall
never
again
be
easy
in
our
minds
at
baskerville
hall
but
what
do
you
intend
to
do
i
have
no
doubt
sir
that
we
shall
succeed
in
establishing
ourselves
in
some
business
sir
charless
generosity
has
given
us
the
means
to
do
so
and
now
sir
perhaps
i
had
best
show
you
to
your
rooms
a
square
balustraded
gallery
ran
round
the
top
of
the
old
hall
approached
by
a
double
stair
from
this
central
point
two
long
corridors
extended
the
whole
length
of
the
building
from
which
all
the
bedrooms
opened
my
own
was
in
the
same
wing
as
baskervilles
and
almost
next
door
to
it
these
rooms
appeared
to
be
much
more
modern
than
the
central
part
of
the
house
and
the
bright
paper
and
numerous
candles
did
something
to
remove
the
sombre
impression
which
our
arrival
had
left
upon
my
mind
but
the
dining
room
which
opened
out
of
the
hall
was
a
place
of
shadow
and
gloom
it
was
a
long
chamber
with
a
step
separating
the
dais
where
the
family
sat
from
the
lower
portion
reserved
for
their
dependents
at
one
end
a
minstrels
gallery
overlooked
it
black
beams
shot
across
above
our
heads
with
a
smoke
darkened
ceiling
beyond
them
with
rows
of
flaring
torches
to
light
it
up
and
the
colour
and
rude
hilarity
of
an
old
time
banquet
it
might
have
softened
but
now
when
two
black
clothed
gentlemen
sat
in
the
little
circle
of
light
thrown
by
a
shaded
lamp
ones
voice
became
hushed
and
ones
spirit
subdued
a
dim
line
of
ancestors
in
every
variety
of
dress
from
the
elizabethan
knight
to
the
buck
of
the
regency
stared
down
upon
us
and
daunted
us
by
their
silent
company
we
talked
little
and
i
for
one
was
glad
when
the
meal
was
over
and
we
were
able
to
retire
into
the
modern
billiard
room
and
smoke
a
cigarette
my
word
it
isnt
a
very
cheerful
place
said
sir
henry
i
suppose
one
can
tone
down
to
it
but
i
feel
a
bit
out
of
the
picture
at
present
i
dont
wonder
that
my
uncle
got
a
little
jumpy
if
he
lived
all
alone
in
such
a
house
as
this
however
if
it
suits
you
we
will
retire
early
tonight
and
perhaps
things
may
seem
more
cheerful
in
the
morning
i
drew
aside
my
curtains
before
i
went
to
bed
and
looked
out
from
my
window
it
opened
upon
the
grassy
space
which
lay
in
front
of
the
hall
door
beyond
two
copses
of
trees
moaned
and
swung
in
a
rising
wind
a
half
moon
broke
through
the
rifts
of
racing
clouds
in
its
cold
light
i
saw
beyond
the
trees
a
broken
fringe
of
rocks
and
the
long
low
curve
of
the
melancholy
moor
i
closed
the
curtain
feeling
that
my
last
impression
was
in
keeping
with
the
rest
and
yet
it
was
not
quite
the
last
i
found
myself
weary
and
yet
wakeful
tossing
restlessly
from
side
to
side
seeking
for
the
sleep
which
would
not
come
far
away
a
chiming
clock
struck
out
the
quarters
of
the
hours
but
otherwise
a
deathly
silence
lay
upon
the
old
house
and
then
suddenly
in
the
very
dead
of
the
night
there
came
a
sound
to
my
ears
clear
resonant
and
unmistakable
it
was
the
sob
of
a
woman
the
muffled
strangling
gasp
of
one
who
is
torn
by
an
uncontrollable
sorrow
i
sat
up
in
bed
and
listened
intently
the
noise
could
not
have
been
far
away
and
was
certainly
in
the
house
for
half
an
hour
i
waited
with
every
nerve
on
the
alert
but
there
came
no
other
sound
save
the
chiming
clock
and
the
rustle
of
the
ivy
on
the
wall
chapter
the
stapletons
of
merripit
house
the
fresh
beauty
of
the
following
morning
did
something
to
efface
from
our
minds
the
grim
and
gray
impression
which
had
been
left
upon
both
of
us
by
our
first
experience
of
baskerville
hall
as
sir
henry
and
i
sat
at
breakfast
the
sunlight
flooded
in
through
the
high
mullioned
windows
throwing
watery
patches
of
colour
from
the
coats
of
arms
which
covered
them
the
dark
panelling
glowed
like
bronze
in
the
golden
rays
and
it
was
hard
to
realize
that
this
was
indeed
the
chamber
which
had
struck
such
a
gloom
into
our
souls
upon
the
evening
before
i
guess
it
is
ourselves
and
not
the
house
that
we
have
to
blame
said
the
baronet
we
were
tired
with
our
journey
and
chilled
by
our
drive
so
we
took
a
gray
view
of
the
place
now
we
are
fresh
and
well
so
it
is
all
cheerful
once
more
and
yet
it
was
not
entirely
a
question
of
imagination
i
answered
did
you
for
example
happen
to
hear
someone
a
woman
i
think
sobbing
in
the
night
that
is
curious
for
i
did
when
i
was
half
asleep
fancy
that
i
heard
something
of
the
sort
i
waited
quite
a
time
but
there
was
no
more
of
it
so
i
concluded
that
it
was
all
a
dream
i
heard
it
distinctly
and
i
am
sure
that
it
was
really
the
sob
of
a
woman
we
must
ask
about
this
right
away
he
rang
the
bell
and
asked
barrymore
whether
he
could
account
for
our
experience
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
pallid
features
of
the
butler
turned
a
shade
paler
still
as
he
listened
to
his
masters
question
there
are
only
two
women
in
the
house
sir
henry
he
answered
one
is
the
scullery
maid
who
sleeps
in
the
other
wing
the
other
is
my
wife
and
i
can
answer
for
it
that
the
sound
could
not
have
come
from
her
and
yet
he
lied
as
he
said
it
for
it
chanced
that
after
breakfast
i
met
mrs
barrymore
in
the
long
corridor
with
the
sun
full
upon
her
face
she
was
a
large
impassive
heavy
featured
woman
with
a
stern
set
expression
of
mouth
but
her
telltale
eyes
were
red
and
glanced
at
me
from
between
swollen
lids
it
was
she
then
who
wept
in
the
night
and
if
she
did
so
her
husband
must
know
it
yet
he
had
taken
the
obvious
risk
of
discovery
in
declaring
that
it
was
not
so
why
had
he
done
this
and
why
did
she
weep
so
bitterly
already
round
this
pale
faced
handsome
black
bearded
man
there
was
gathering
an
atmosphere
of
mystery
and
of
gloom
it
was
he
who
had
been
the
first
to
discover
the
body
of
sir
charles
and
we
had
only
his
word
for
all
the
circumstances
which
led
up
to
the
old
man
death
was
it
possible
that
it
was
barrymore
after
all
whom
we
had
seen
in
the
cab
in
regent
street
the
beard
might
well
have
been
the
same
the
cabman
had
described
a
somewhat
shorter
man
but
such
an
impression
might
easily
have
been
erroneous
how
could
i
settle
the
point
forever
obviously
the
first
thing
to
do
was
to
see
the
grimpen
postmaster
and
find
whether
the
test
telegram
had
really
been
placed
in
barrymores
own
hands
be
the
answer
what
it
might
i
should
at
least
have
something
to
report
to
sherlock
holmes
sir
henry
had
numerous
papers
to
examine
after
breakfast
so
that
the
time
was
propitious
for
my
excursion
it
was
a
pleasant
walk
of
four
miles
along
the
edge
of
the
moor
leading
me
at
last
to
a
small
gray
hamlet
in
which
two
larger
buildings
which
proved
to
be
the
inn
and
the
house
of
dr
mortimer
stood
high
above
the
rest
the
postmaster
who
was
also
the
village
grocer
had
a
clear
recollection
of
the
telegram
certainly
sir
said
he
i
had
the
telegram
delivered
to
mr
barrymore
exactly
as
directed
who
delivered
it
my
boy
here
james
you
delivered
that
telegram
to
mr
barrymore
at
the
hall
last
week
did
you
not
yes
father
i
delivered
it
into
his
own
hands
i
asked
well
he
was
up
in
the
loft
at
the
time
so
that
i
could
not
put
it
into
his
own
hands
but
i
gave
it
into
mrs
barrymores
hands
and
she
promised
to
deliver
it
at
once
did
you
see
mr
barrymore
no
sir
i
tell
you
he
was
in
the
loft
if
you
didnt
see
him
how
do
you
know
he
was
in
the
loft
well
surely
his
own
wife
ought
to
know
where
he
is
said
the
postmaster
testily
didnt
he
get
the
telegram
if
there
is
any
mistake
it
is
for
mr
barrymore
himself
to
complain
it
seemed
hopeless
to
pursue
the
inquiry
any
farther
but
it
was
clear
that
in
spite
of
holmess
ruse
we
had
no
proof
that
barrymore
had
not
been
in
london
all
the
time
suppose
that
it
were
so
suppose
that
the
same
man
had
been
the
last
who
had
seen
sir
charles
alive
and
the
first
to
dog
the
new
heir
when
he
returned
to
england
what
then
was
he
the
agent
of
others
or
had
he
some
sinister
design
of
his
own
what
interest
could
he
have
in
persecuting
the
baskerville
family
i
thought
of
the
strange
warning
clipped
out
of
the
leading
article
of
the
times
was
that
his
work
or
was
it
possibly
the
doing
of
someone
who
was
bent
upon
counteracting
his
schemes
the
only
conceivable
motive
was
that
which
had
been
suggested
by
sir
henry
that
if
the
family
could
be
scared
away
a
comfortable
and
permanent
home
would
be
secured
for
the
barrymores
but
surely
such
an
explanation
as
that
would
be
quite
inadequate
to
account
for
the
deep
and
subtle
scheming
which
seemed
to
be
weaving
an
invisible
net
round
the
young
baronet
holmes
himself
had
said
that
no
more
complex
case
had
come
to
him
in
all
the
long
series
of
his
sensational
investigations
i
prayed
as
i
walked
back
along
the
gray
lonely
road
that
my
friend
might
soon
be
freed
from
his
preoccupations
and
able
to
come
down
to
take
this
heavy
burden
of
responsibility
from
my
shoulders
suddenly
my
thoughts
were
interrupted
by
the
sound
of
running
feet
behind
me
and
by
a
voice
which
called
me
by
name
i
turned
expecting
to
see
dr
mortimer
but
to
my
surprise
it
was
a
stranger
who
was
pursuing
me
he
was
a
small
slim
clean
shaven
prim
faced
man
flaxen
haired
and
leanjawed
between
thirty
and
forty
years
of
age
dressed
in
a
gray
suit
and
wearing
a
straw
hat
a
tin
box
for
botanical
specimens
hung
over
his
shoulder
and
he
carried
a
green
butterfly
net
in
one
of
his
hands
you
will
i
am
sure
excuse
my
presumption
dr
watson
said
he
as
he
came
panting
up
to
where
i
stood
here
on
the
moor
we
are
homely
folk
and
do
not
wait
for
formal
introductions
you
may
possibly
have
heard
my
name
from
our
mutual
friend
mortimer
i
am
stapleton
of
merripit
house
your
net
and
box
would
have
told
me
as
much
said
i
for
i
knew
that
mr
stapleton
was
a
naturalist
but
how
did
you
know
me
i
have
been
calling
on
mortimer
and
he
pointed
you
out
to
me
from
the
window
of
his
surgery
as
you
passed
as
our
road
lay
the
same
way
i
thought
that
i
would
overtake
you
and
introduce
myself
i
trust
that
sir
henry
is
none
the
worse
for
his
journey
he
is
very
well
thank
you
we
were
all
rather
afraid
that
after
the
sad
death
of
sir
charles
the
new
baronet
might
refuse
to
live
here
it
is
asking
much
of
a
wealthy
man
to
come
down
and
bury
himself
in
a
place
of
this
kind
but
i
need
not
tell
you
that
it
means
a
very
great
deal
to
the
countryside
sir
henry
has
i
suppose
no
superstitious
fears
in
the
matter
i
do
not
think
that
it
is
likely
of
course
you
know
the
legend
of
the
fiend
dog
which
haunts
the
family
i
have
heard
it
it
is
extraordinary
how
credulous
the
peasants
are
about
here
any
number
of
them
are
ready
to
swear
that
they
have
seen
such
a
creature
upon
the
moor
he
spoke
with
a
smile
but
i
seemed
to
read
in
his
eyes
that
he
took
the
matter
more
seriously
the
story
took
a
great
hold
upon
the
imagination
of
sir
charles
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
it
led
to
his
tragic
end
but
how
his
nerves
were
so
worked
up
that
the
appearance
of
any
dog
might
have
had
a
fatal
effect
upon
his
diseased
heart
i
fancy
that
he
really
did
see
something
of
the
kind
upon
that
last
night
in
the
yew
alley
i
feared
that
some
disaster
might
occur
for
i
was
very
fond
of
the
old
man
and
i
knew
that
his
heart
was
weak
how
did
you
know
that
my
friend
mortimer
told
me
you
think
then
that
some
dog
pursued
sir
charles
and
that
he
died
of
fright
in
consequence
have
you
any
better
explanation
i
have
not
come
to
any
conclusion
has
mr
sherlock
holmes
the
words
took
away
my
breath
for
an
instant
but
a
glance
at
the
placid
face
and
steadfast
eyes
of
my
companion
showed
that
no
surprise
was
intended
it
is
useless
for
us
to
pretend
that
we
do
not
know
you
dr
watson
said
he
the
records
of
your
detective
have
reached
us
here
and
you
could
not
celebrate
him
without
being
known
yourself
when
mortimer
told
me
your
name
he
could
not
deny
your
identity
if
you
are
here
then
it
follows
that
mr
sherlock
holmes
is
interesting
himself
in
the
matter
and
i
am
naturally
curious
to
know
what
view
he
may
take
i
am
afraid
that
i
cannot
answer
that
question
may
i
ask
if
he
is
going
to
honour
us
with
a
visit
himself
he
cannot
leave
town
at
present
he
has
other
cases
which
engage
his
attention
what
a
pity
he
might
throw
some
light
on
that
which
is
so
dark
to
us
but
as
to
your
own
researches
if
there
is
any
possible
way
in
which
i
can
be
of
service
to
you
i
trust
that
you
will
command
me
if
i
had
any
indication
of
the
nature
of
your
suspicions
or
how
you
propose
to
investigate
the
case
i
might
perhaps
even
now
give
you
some
aid
or
advice
i
assure
you
that
i
am
simply
here
upon
a
visit
to
my
friend
sir
henry
and
that
i
need
no
help
of
any
kind
excellent
said
stapleton
you
are
perfectly
right
to
be
wary
and
discreet
i
am
justly
reproved
for
what
i
feel
was
an
unjustifiable
intrusion
and
i
promise
you
that
i
will
not
mention
the
matter
again
we
had
come
to
a
point
where
a
narrow
grassy
path
struck
off
from
the
road
and
wound
away
across
the
moor
a
steep
boulder
sprinkled
hill
lay
upon
the
right
which
had
in
bygone
days
been
cut
into
a
granite
quarry
the
face
which
was
turned
towards
us
formed
a
dark
cliff
with
ferns
and
brambles
growing
in
its
niches
from
over
a
distant
rise
there
floated
a
gray
plume
of
smoke
a
moderate
walk
along
this
moor
path
brings
us
to
merripit
house
said
he
perhaps
you
will
spare
an
hour
that
i
may
have
the
pleasure
of
introducing
you
to
my
sister
my
first
thought
was
that
i
should
be
by
sir
henrys
side
but
then
i
remembered
the
pile
of
papers
and
bills
with
which
his
study
table
was
littered
it
was
certain
that
i
could
not
help
with
those
and
holmes
had
expressly
said
that
i
should
study
the
neighbours
upon
the
moor
i
accepted
stapletons
invitation
and
we
turned
together
down
the
path
it
is
a
wonderful
place
the
moor
said
he
looking
round
over
the
undulating
downs
long
green
rollers
with
crests
of
jagged
granite
foaming
up
into
fantastic
surges
you
never
tire
of
the
moor
you
cannot
think
the
wonderful
secrets
which
it
contains
it
is
so
vast
and
so
barren
and
so
mysterious
you
know
it
well
then
i
have
only
been
here
two
years
the
residents
would
call
me
a
newcomer
we
came
shortly
after
sir
charles
settled
but
my
tastes
led
me
to
explore
every
part
of
the
country
round
and
i
should
think
that
there
are
few
men
who
know
it
better
than
i
do
is
it
hard
to
know
very
hard
you
see
for
example
this
great
plain
to
the
north
here
with
the
queer
hills
breaking
out
of
it
do
you
observe
anything
remarkable
about
that
it
would
be
a
rare
place
for
a
gallop
you
would
naturally
think
so
and
the
thought
has
cost
several
their
lives
before
now
you
notice
those
bright
green
spots
scattered
thickly
over
it
yes
they
seem
more
fertile
than
the
rest
stapleton
laughed
that
is
the
great
grimpen
mire
said
he
a
false
step
yonder
means
death
to
man
or
beast
only
yesterday
i
saw
one
of
the
moor
ponies
wander
into
it
he
never
came
out
i
saw
his
head
for
quite
a
long
time
craning
out
of
the
bog
hole
but
it
sucked
him
down
at
last
even
in
dry
seasons
it
is
a
danger
to
cross
it
but
after
these
autumn
rains
it
is
an
awful
place
and
yet
i
can
find
my
way
to
the
very
heart
of
it
and
return
alive
by
george
there
is
another
of
those
miserable
ponies
something
brown
was
rolling
and
tossing
among
the
green
sedges
then
a
long
agonized
writhing
neck
shot
upward
and
a
dreadful
cry
echoed
over
the
moor
it
turned
me
cold
with
horror
but
my
companions
nerves
seemed
to
be
stronger
than
mine
its
gone
said
he
the
mire
has
him
two
in
two
days
and
many
more
perhaps
for
they
get
in
the
way
of
going
there
in
the
dry
weather
and
never
know
the
difference
until
the
mire
has
them
in
its
clutches
it
a
bad
place
the
great
grimpen
mire
and
you
say
you
can
penetrate
it
yes
there
are
one
or
two
paths
which
a
very
active
man
can
take
i
have
found
them
out
but
why
should
you
wish
to
go
into
so
horrible
a
place
well
you
see
the
hills
beyond
they
are
really
islands
cut
off
on
all
sides
by
the
impassable
mire
which
has
crawled
round
them
in
the
course
of
years
that
is
where
the
rare
plants
and
the
butterflies
are
if
you
have
the
wit
to
reach
them
i
shall
try
my
luck
some
day
he
looked
at
me
with
a
surprised
face
for
gods
sake
put
such
an
idea
out
of
your
mind
said
he
your
blood
would
be
upon
my
head
i
assure
you
that
there
would
not
be
the
least
chance
of
your
coming
back
alive
it
is
only
by
remembering
certain
complex
landmarks
that
i
am
able
to
do
it
halloa
i
cried
what
is
that
a
long
low
moan
indescribably
sad
swept
over
the
moor
it
filled
the
whole
air
and
yet
it
was
impossible
to
say
whence
it
came
from
a
dull
murmur
it
swelled
into
a
deep
roar
and
then
sank
back
into
a
melancholy
throbbing
murmur
once
again
stapleton
looked
at
me
with
a
curious
expression
in
his
face
queer
place
the
moor
said
he
but
what
is
it
the
peasants
say
it
is
the
hound
of
the
baskervilles
calling
for
its
prey
ive
heard
it
once
or
twice
before
but
never
quite
so
loud
i
looked
round
with
a
chill
of
fear
in
my
heart
at
the
huge
swelling
plain
mottled
with
the
green
patches
of
rushes
nothing
stirred
over
the
vast
expanse
save
a
pair
of
ravens
which
croaked
loudly
from
a
tor
behind
us
you
are
an
educated
man
you
dont
believe
such
nonsense
as
that
said
i
what
do
you
think
is
the
cause
of
so
strange
a
sound
bogs
make
queer
noises
sometimes
its
the
mud
settling
or
the
water
rising
or
something
no
no
that
was
a
living
voice
well
perhaps
it
was
did
you
ever
hear
a
bittern
booming
no
i
never
did
its
a
very
rare
bird
practically
extinct
in
england
now
but
all
things
are
possible
upon
the
moor
yes
i
should
not
be
surprised
to
learn
that
what
we
have
heard
is
the
cry
of
the
last
of
the
bitterns
its
the
weirdest
strangest
thing
that
ever
i
heard
in
my
life
yes
its
rather
an
uncanny
place
altogether
look
at
the
hillside
yonder
what
do
you
make
of
those
the
whole
steep
slope
was
covered
with
gray
circular
rings
of
stone
a
score
of
them
at
least
what
are
they
sheep
pens
no
they
are
the
homes
of
our
worthy
ancestors
prehistoric
man
lived
thickly
on
the
moor
and
as
no
one
in
particular
has
lived
there
since
we
find
all
his
little
arrangements
exactly
as
he
left
them
these
are
his
wigwams
with
the
roofs
off
you
can
even
see
his
hearth
and
his
couch
if
you
have
the
curiosity
to
go
inside
but
it
is
quite
a
town
when
was
it
inhabited
neolithic
man
no
date
what
did
he
do
he
grazed
his
cattle
on
these
slopes
and
he
learned
to
dig
for
tin
when
the
bronze
sword
began
to
supersede
the
stone
axe
look
at
the
great
trench
in
the
opposite
hill
that
is
his
mark
yes
you
will
find
some
very
singular
points
about
the
moor
dr
watson
oh
excuse
me
an
instant
it
is
surely
cyclopides
a
small
fly
or
moth
had
fluttered
across
our
path
and
in
an
instant
stapleton
was
rushing
with
extraordinary
energy
and
speed
in
pursuit
of
it
to
my
dismay
the
creature
flew
straight
for
the
great
mire
and
my
acquaintance
never
paused
for
an
instant
bounding
from
tuft
to
tuft
behind
it
his
green
net
waving
in
the
air
his
gray
clothes
and
jerky
zigzag
irregular
progress
made
him
not
unlike
some
huge
moth
himself
i
was
standing
watching
his
pursuit
with
a
mixture
of
admiration
for
his
extraordinary
activity
and
fear
lest
he
should
lose
his
footing
in
the
treacherous
mire
when
i
heard
the
sound
of
steps
and
turning
round
found
a
woman
near
me
upon
the
path
she
had
come
from
the
direction
in
which
the
plume
of
smoke
indicated
the
position
of
merripit
house
but
the
dip
of
the
moor
had
hid
her
until
she
was
quite
close
i
could
not
doubt
that
this
was
the
miss
stapleton
of
whom
i
had
been
told
since
ladies
of
any
sort
must
be
few
upon
the
moor
and
i
remembered
that
i
had
heard
someone
describe
her
as
being
a
beauty
the
woman
who
approached
me
was
certainly
that
and
of
a
most
uncommon
type
there
could
not
have
been
a
greater
contrast
between
brother
and
sister
for
stapleton
was
neutral
tinted
with
light
hair
and
gray
eyes
while
she
was
darker
than
any
brunette
whom
i
have
seen
in
england
slim
elegant
and
tall
she
had
a
proud
finely
cut
face
so
regular
that
it
might
have
seemed
impassive
were
it
not
for
the
sensitive
mouth
and
the
beautiful
dark
eager
eyes
with
her
perfect
figure
and
elegant
dress
she
was
indeed
a
strange
apparition
upon
a
lonely
moorland
path
her
eyes
were
on
her
brother
as
i
turned
and
then
she
quickened
her
pace
towards
me
i
had
raised
my
hat
and
was
about
to
make
some
explanatory
remark
when
her
own
words
turned
all
my
thoughts
into
a
new
channel
go
back
she
said
go
straight
back
to
london
instantly
i
could
only
stare
at
her
in
stupid
surprise
her
eyes
blazed
at
me
and
she
tapped
the
ground
impatiently
with
her
foot
why
should
i
go
back
i
asked
i
cannot
explain
she
spoke
in
a
low
eager
voice
with
a
curious
lisp
in
her
utterance
but
for
gods
sake
do
what
i
ask
you
go
back
and
never
set
foot
upon
the
moor
again
but
i
have
only
just
come
man
man
she
cried
can
you
not
tell
when
a
warning
is
for
your
own
good
go
back
to
london
start
tonight
get
away
from
this
place
at
all
costs
hush
my
brother
is
coming
not
a
word
of
what
i
have
said
would
you
mind
getting
that
orchid
for
me
among
the
mares
tails
yonder
we
are
very
rich
in
orchids
on
the
moor
though
of
course
you
are
rather
late
to
see
the
beauties
of
the
place
stapleton
had
abandoned
the
chase
and
came
back
to
us
breathing
hard
and
flushed
with
his
exertions
halloa
beryl
said
he
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
tone
of
his
greeting
was
not
altogether
a
cordial
one
well
jack
you
are
very
hot
yes
i
was
chasing
a
cyclopides
he
is
very
rare
and
seldom
found
in
the
late
autumn
what
a
pity
that
i
should
have
missed
him
he
spoke
unconcernedly
but
his
small
light
eyes
glanced
incessantly
from
the
girl
to
me
you
have
introduced
yourselves
i
can
see
yes
i
was
telling
sir
henry
that
it
was
rather
late
for
him
to
see
the
true
beauties
of
the
moor
why
who
do
you
think
this
is
i
imagine
that
it
must
be
sir
henry
baskerville
no
no
said
i
only
a
humble
commoner
but
his
friend
my
name
is
dr
watson
a
flush
of
vexation
passed
over
her
expressive
face
we
have
been
talking
at
cross
purposes
said
she
why
you
had
not
very
much
time
for
talk
her
brother
remarked
with
the
same
questioning
eyes
i
talked
as
if
dr
watson
were
a
resident
instead
of
being
merely
a
visitor
said
she
it
cannot
much
matter
to
him
whether
it
is
early
or
late
for
the
orchids
but
you
will
come
on
will
you
not
and
see
merripit
house
a
short
walk
brought
us
to
it
a
bleak
moorland
house
once
the
farm
of
some
grazier
in
the
old
prosperous
days
but
now
put
into
repair
and
turned
into
a
modern
dwelling
an
orchard
surrounded
it
but
the
trees
as
is
usual
upon
the
moor
were
stunted
and
nipped
and
the
effect
of
the
whole
place
was
mean
and
melancholy
we
were
admitted
by
a
strange
wizened
rusty
coated
old
manservant
who
seemed
in
keeping
with
the
house
inside
however
there
were
large
rooms
furnished
with
an
elegance
in
which
i
seemed
to
recognize
the
taste
of
the
lady
as
i
looked
from
their
windows
at
the
interminable
granite
flecked
moor
rolling
unbroken
to
the
farthest
horizon
i
could
not
but
marvel
at
what
could
have
brought
this
highly
educated
man
and
this
beautiful
woman
to
live
in
such
a
place
queer
spot
to
choose
is
it
not
said
he
as
if
in
answer
to
my
thought
and
yet
we
manage
to
make
ourselves
fairly
happy
do
we
not
beryl
quite
happy
said
she
but
there
was
no
ring
of
conviction
in
her
words
i
had
a
school
said
stapleton
it
was
in
the
north
country
the
work
to
a
man
of
my
temperament
was
mechanical
and
uninteresting
but
the
privilege
of
living
with
youth
of
helping
to
mould
those
young
minds
and
of
impressing
them
with
ones
own
character
and
ideals
was
very
dear
to
me
however
the
fates
were
against
us
a
serious
epidemic
broke
out
in
the
school
and
three
of
the
boys
died
it
never
recovered
from
the
blow
and
much
of
my
capital
was
irretrievably
swallowed
up
and
yet
if
it
were
not
for
the
loss
of
the
charming
companionship
of
the
boys
i
could
rejoice
over
my
own
misfortune
for
with
my
strong
tastes
for
botany
and
zoology
i
find
an
unlimited
field
of
work
here
and
my
sister
is
as
devoted
to
nature
as
i
am
all
this
dr
watson
has
been
brought
upon
your
head
by
your
expression
as
you
surveyed
the
moor
out
of
our
window
it
certainly
did
cross
my
mind
that
it
might
be
a
little
dull
less
for
you
perhaps
than
for
your
sister
no
no
i
am
never
dull
said
she
quickly
we
have
books
we
have
our
studies
and
we
have
interesting
neighbours
dr
mortimer
is
a
most
learned
man
in
his
own
line
poor
sir
charles
was
also
an
admirable
companion
we
knew
him
well
and
miss
him
more
than
i
can
tell
do
you
think
that
i
should
intrude
if
i
were
to
call
this
afternoon
and
make
the
acquaintance
of
sir
henry
i
am
sure
that
he
would
be
delighted
then
perhaps
you
would
mention
that
i
propose
to
do
so
we
may
in
our
humble
way
do
something
to
make
things
more
easy
for
him
until
he
becomes
accustomed
to
his
new
surroundings
will
you
come
upstairs
dr
watson
and
inspect
my
collection
of
lepidoptera
i
think
it
is
the
most
complete
one
in
the
south
west
of
england
by
the
time
that
you
have
looked
through
them
lunch
will
be
almost
ready
but
i
was
eager
to
get
back
to
my
charge
the
melancholy
of
the
moor
the
death
of
the
unfortunate
pony
the
weird
sound
which
had
been
associated
with
the
grim
legend
of
the
baskervilles
all
these
things
tinged
my
thoughts
with
sadness
then
on
the
top
of
these
more
or
less
vague
impressions
there
had
come
the
definite
and
distinct
warning
of
miss
stapleton
delivered
with
such
intense
earnestness
that
i
could
not
doubt
that
some
grave
and
deep
reason
lay
behind
it
i
resisted
all
pressure
to
stay
for
lunch
and
i
set
off
at
once
upon
my
return
journey
taking
the
grass
grown
path
by
which
we
had
come
it
seems
however
that
there
must
have
been
some
short
cut
for
those
who
knew
it
for
before
i
had
reached
the
road
i
was
astounded
to
see
miss
stapleton
sitting
upon
a
rock
by
the
side
of
the
track
her
face
was
beautifully
flushed
with
her
exertions
and
she
held
her
hand
to
her
side
i
have
run
all
the
way
in
order
to
cut
you
off
dr
watson
said
she
i
had
not
even
time
to
put
on
my
hat
i
must
not
stop
or
my
brother
may
miss
me
i
wanted
to
say
to
you
how
sorry
i
am
about
the
stupid
mistake
i
made
in
thinking
that
you
were
sir
henry
please
forget
the
words
i
said
which
have
no
application
whatever
to
you
but
i
cant
forget
them
miss
stapleton
said
i
i
am
sir
henry
friend
and
his
welfare
is
a
very
close
concern
of
mine
tell
me
why
it
was
that
you
were
so
eager
that
sir
henry
should
return
to
london
a
womans
whim
dr
watson
when
you
know
me
better
you
will
understand
that
i
cannot
always
give
reasons
for
what
i
say
or
do
no
no
i
remember
the
thrill
in
your
voice
i
remember
the
look
in
your
eyes
please
please
be
frank
with
me
miss
stapleton
for
ever
since
i
have
been
here
i
have
been
conscious
of
shadows
all
round
me
life
has
become
like
that
great
grimpen
mire
with
little
green
patches
everywhere
into
which
one
may
sink
and
with
no
guide
to
point
the
track
tell
me
then
what
it
was
that
you
meant
and
i
will
promise
to
convey
your
warning
to
sir
henry
an
expression
of
irresolution
passed
for
an
instant
over
her
face
but
her
eyes
had
hardened
again
when
she
answered
me
you
make
too
much
of
it
dr
watson
said
she
my
brother
and
i
were
very
much
shocked
by
the
death
of
sir
charles
we
knew
him
very
intimately
for
his
favourite
walk
was
over
the
moor
to
our
house
he
was
deeply
impressed
with
the
curse
which
hung
over
the
family
and
when
this
tragedy
came
i
naturally
felt
that
there
must
be
some
grounds
for
the
fears
which
he
had
expressed
i
was
distressed
therefore
when
another
member
of
the
family
came
down
to
live
here
and
i
felt
that
he
should
be
warned
of
the
danger
which
he
will
run
that
was
all
which
i
intended
to
convey
but
what
is
the
danger
you
know
the
story
of
the
hound
i
do
not
believe
in
such
nonsense
but
i
do
if
you
have
any
influence
with
sir
henry
take
him
away
from
a
place
which
has
always
been
fatal
to
his
family
the
world
is
wide
why
should
he
wish
to
live
at
the
place
of
danger
because
it
is
the
place
of
danger
that
is
sir
henrys
nature
i
fear
that
unless
you
can
give
me
some
more
definite
information
than
this
it
would
be
impossible
to
get
him
to
move
i
cannot
say
anything
definite
for
i
do
not
know
anything
definite
i
would
ask
you
one
more
question
miss
stapleton
if
you
meant
no
more
than
this
when
you
first
spoke
to
me
why
should
you
not
wish
your
brother
to
overhear
what
you
said
there
is
nothing
to
which
he
or
anyone
else
could
object
my
brother
is
very
anxious
to
have
the
hall
inhabited
for
he
thinks
it
is
for
the
good
of
the
poor
folk
upon
the
moor
he
would
be
very
angry
if
he
knew
that
i
have
said
anything
which
might
induce
sir
henry
to
go
away
but
i
have
done
my
duty
now
and
i
will
say
no
more
i
must
go
back
or
he
will
miss
me
and
suspect
that
i
have
seen
you
good
bye
she
turned
and
had
disappeared
in
a
few
minutes
among
the
scattered
boulders
while
i
with
my
soul
full
of
vague
fears
pursued
my
way
to
baskerville
hall
chapter
first
report
of
dr
watson
from
this
point
onward
i
will
follow
the
course
of
events
by
transcribing
my
own
letters
to
mr
sherlock
holmes
which
lie
before
me
on
the
table
one
page
is
missing
but
otherwise
they
are
exactly
as
written
and
show
my
feelings
and
suspicions
of
the
moment
more
accurately
than
my
memory
clear
as
it
is
upon
these
tragic
events
can
possibly
do
baskerville
hall
october
th
my
dear
holmes
my
previous
letters
and
telegrams
have
kept
you
pretty
well
up
to
date
as
to
all
that
has
occurred
in
this
most
god
forsaken
corner
of
the
world
the
longer
one
stays
here
the
more
does
the
spirit
of
the
moor
sink
into
ones
soul
its
vastness
and
also
its
grim
charm
when
you
are
once
out
upon
its
bosom
you
have
left
all
traces
of
modern
england
behind
you
but
on
the
other
hand
you
are
conscious
everywhere
of
the
homes
and
the
work
of
the
prehistoric
people
on
all
sides
of
you
as
you
walk
are
the
houses
of
these
forgotten
folk
with
their
graves
and
the
huge
monoliths
which
are
supposed
to
have
marked
their
temples
as
you
look
at
their
gray
stone
huts
against
the
scarred
hillsides
you
leave
your
own
age
behind
you
and
if
you
were
to
see
a
skin
clad
hairy
man
crawl
out
from
the
low
door
fitting
a
flint
tipped
arrow
on
to
the
string
of
his
bow
you
would
feel
that
his
presence
there
was
more
natural
than
your
own
the
strange
thing
is
that
they
should
have
lived
so
thickly
on
what
must
always
have
been
most
unfruitful
soil
i
am
no
antiquarian
but
i
could
imagine
that
they
were
some
unwarlike
and
harried
race
who
were
forced
to
accept
that
which
none
other
would
occupy
all
this
however
is
foreign
to
the
mission
on
which
you
sent
me
and
will
probably
be
very
uninteresting
to
your
severely
practical
mind
i
can
still
remember
your
complete
indifference
as
to
whether
the
sun
moved
round
the
earth
or
the
earth
round
the
sun
let
me
therefore
return
to
the
facts
concerning
sir
henry
baskerville
if
you
have
not
had
any
report
within
the
last
few
days
it
is
because
up
to
today
there
was
nothing
of
importance
to
relate
then
a
very
surprising
circumstance
occurred
which
i
shall
tell
you
in
due
course
but
first
of
all
i
must
keep
you
in
touch
with
some
of
the
other
factors
in
the
situation
one
of
these
concerning
which
i
have
said
little
is
the
escaped
convict
upon
the
moor
there
is
strong
reason
now
to
believe
that
he
has
got
right
away
which
is
a
considerable
relief
to
the
lonely
householders
of
this
district
a
fortnight
has
passed
since
his
flight
during
which
he
has
not
been
seen
and
nothing
has
been
heard
of
him
it
is
surely
inconceivable
that
he
could
have
held
out
upon
the
moor
during
all
that
time
of
course
so
far
as
his
concealment
goes
there
is
no
difficulty
at
all
any
one
of
these
stone
huts
would
give
him
a
hiding
place
but
there
is
nothing
to
eat
unless
he
were
to
catch
and
slaughter
one
of
the
moor
sheep
we
think
therefore
that
he
has
gone
and
the
outlying
farmers
sleep
the
better
in
consequence
we
are
four
able
bodied
men
in
this
household
so
that
we
could
take
good
care
of
ourselves
but
i
confess
that
i
have
had
uneasy
moments
when
i
have
thought
of
the
stapletons
they
live
miles
from
any
help
there
are
one
maid
an
old
manservant
the
sister
and
the
brother
the
latter
not
a
very
strong
man
they
would
be
helpless
in
the
hands
of
a
desperate
fellow
like
this
notting
hill
criminal
if
he
could
once
effect
an
entrance
both
sir
henry
and
i
were
concerned
at
their
situation
and
it
was
suggested
that
perkins
the
groom
should
go
over
to
sleep
there
but
stapleton
would
not
hear
of
it
the
fact
is
that
our
friend
the
baronet
begins
to
display
a
considerable
interest
in
our
fair
neighbour
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
for
time
hangs
heavily
in
this
lonely
spot
to
an
active
man
like
him
and
she
is
a
very
fascinating
and
beautiful
woman
there
is
something
tropical
and
exotic
about
her
which
forms
a
singular
contrast
to
her
cool
and
unemotional
brother
yet
he
also
gives
the
idea
of
hidden
fires
he
has
certainly
a
very
marked
influence
over
her
for
i
have
seen
her
continually
glance
at
him
as
she
talked
as
if
seeking
approbation
for
what
she
said
i
trust
that
he
is
kind
to
her
there
is
a
dry
glitter
in
his
eyes
and
a
firm
set
of
his
thin
lips
which
goes
with
a
positive
and
possibly
a
harsh
nature
you
would
find
him
an
interesting
study
he
came
over
to
call
upon
baskerville
on
that
first
day
and
the
very
next
morning
he
took
us
both
to
show
us
the
spot
where
the
legend
of
the
wicked
hugo
is
supposed
to
have
had
its
origin
it
was
an
excursion
of
some
miles
across
the
moor
to
a
place
which
is
so
dismal
that
it
might
have
suggested
the
story
we
found
a
short
valley
between
rugged
tors
which
led
to
an
open
grassy
space
flecked
over
with
the
white
cotton
grass
in
the
middle
of
it
rose
two
great
stones
worn
and
sharpened
at
the
upper
end
until
they
looked
like
the
huge
corroding
fangs
of
some
monstrous
beast
in
every
way
it
corresponded
with
the
scene
of
the
old
tragedy
sir
henry
was
much
interested
and
asked
stapleton
more
than
once
whether
he
did
really
believe
in
the
possibility
of
the
interference
of
the
supernatural
in
the
affairs
of
men
he
spoke
lightly
but
it
was
evident
that
he
was
very
much
in
earnest
stapleton
was
guarded
in
his
replies
but
it
was
easy
to
see
that
he
said
less
than
he
might
and
that
he
would
not
express
his
whole
opinion
out
of
consideration
for
the
feelings
of
the
baronet
he
told
us
of
similar
cases
where
families
had
suffered
from
some
evil
influence
and
he
left
us
with
the
impression
that
he
shared
the
popular
view
upon
the
matter
on
our
way
back
we
stayed
for
lunch
at
merripit
house
and
it
was
there
that
sir
henry
made
the
acquaintance
of
miss
stapleton
from
the
first
moment
that
he
saw
her
he
appeared
to
be
strongly
attracted
by
her
and
i
am
much
mistaken
if
the
feeling
was
not
mutual
he
referred
to
her
again
and
again
on
our
walk
home
and
since
then
hardly
a
day
has
passed
that
we
have
not
seen
something
of
the
brother
and
sister
they
dine
here
tonight
and
there
is
some
talk
of
our
going
to
them
next
week
one
would
imagine
that
such
a
match
would
be
very
welcome
to
stapleton
and
yet
i
have
more
than
once
caught
a
look
of
the
strongest
disapprobation
in
his
face
when
sir
henry
has
been
paying
some
attention
to
his
sister
he
is
much
attached
to
her
no
doubt
and
would
lead
a
lonely
life
without
her
but
it
would
seem
the
height
of
selfishness
if
he
were
to
stand
in
the
way
of
her
making
so
brilliant
a
marriage
yet
i
am
certain
that
he
does
not
wish
their
intimacy
to
ripen
into
love
and
i
have
several
times
observed
that
he
has
taken
pains
to
prevent
them
from
being
tete
a
tete
by
the
way
your
instructions
to
me
never
to
allow
sir
henry
to
go
out
alone
will
become
very
much
more
onerous
if
a
love
affair
were
to
be
added
to
our
other
difficulties
my
popularity
would
soon
suffer
if
i
were
to
carry
out
your
orders
to
the
letter
the
other
day
thursday
to
be
more
exact
dr
mortimer
lunched
with
us
he
has
been
excavating
a
barrow
at
long
down
and
has
got
a
prehistoric
skull
which
fills
him
with
great
joy
never
was
there
such
a
single
minded
enthusiast
as
he
the
stapletons
came
in
afterwards
and
the
good
doctor
took
us
all
to
the
yew
alley
at
sir
henrys
request
to
show
us
exactly
how
everything
occurred
upon
that
fatal
night
it
is
a
long
dismal
walk
the
yew
alley
between
two
high
walls
of
clipped
hedge
with
a
narrow
band
of
grass
upon
either
side
at
the
far
end
is
an
old
tumble
down
summer
house
halfway
down
is
the
moor
gate
where
the
old
gentleman
left
his
cigar
ash
it
is
a
white
wooden
gate
with
a
latch
beyond
it
lies
the
wide
moor
i
remembered
your
theory
of
the
affair
and
tried
to
picture
all
that
had
occurred
as
the
old
man
stood
there
he
saw
something
coming
across
the
moor
something
which
terrified
him
so
that
he
lost
his
wits
and
ran
and
ran
until
he
died
of
sheer
horror
and
exhaustion
there
was
the
long
gloomy
tunnel
down
which
he
fled
and
from
what
a
sheep
dog
of
the
moor
or
a
spectral
hound
black
silent
and
monstrous
was
there
a
human
agency
in
the
matter
did
the
pale
watchful
barrymore
know
more
than
he
cared
to
say
it
was
all
dim
and
vague
but
always
there
is
the
dark
shadow
of
crime
behind
it
one
other
neighbour
i
have
met
since
i
wrote
last
this
is
mr
frankland
of
lafter
hall
who
lives
some
four
miles
to
the
south
of
us
he
is
an
elderly
man
red
faced
white
haired
and
choleric
his
passion
is
for
the
british
law
and
he
has
spent
a
large
fortune
in
litigation
he
fights
for
the
mere
pleasure
of
fighting
and
is
equally
ready
to
take
up
either
side
of
a
question
so
that
it
is
no
wonder
that
he
has
found
it
a
costly
amusement
sometimes
he
will
shut
up
a
right
of
way
and
defy
the
parish
to
make
him
open
it
at
others
he
will
with
his
own
hands
tear
down
some
other
mans
gate
and
declare
that
a
path
has
existed
there
from
time
immemorial
defying
the
owner
to
prosecute
him
for
trespass
he
is
learned
in
old
manorial
and
communal
rights
and
he
applies
his
knowledge
sometimes
in
favour
of
the
villagers
of
fernworthy
and
sometimes
against
them
so
that
he
is
periodically
either
carried
in
triumph
down
the
village
street
or
else
burned
in
effigy
according
to
his
latest
exploit
he
is
said
to
have
about
seven
lawsuits
upon
his
hands
at
present
which
will
probably
swallow
up
the
remainder
of
his
fortune
and
so
draw
his
sting
and
leave
him
harmless
for
the
future
apart
from
the
law
he
seems
a
kindly
good
natured
person
and
i
only
mention
him
because
you
were
particular
that
i
should
send
some
description
of
the
people
who
surround
us
he
is
curiously
employed
at
present
for
being
an
amateur
astronomer
he
has
an
excellent
telescope
with
which
he
lies
upon
the
roof
of
his
own
house
and
sweeps
the
moor
all
day
in
the
hope
of
catching
a
glimpse
of
the
escaped
convict
if
he
would
confine
his
energies
to
this
all
would
be
well
but
there
are
rumours
that
he
intends
to
prosecute
dr
mortimer
for
opening
a
grave
without
the
consent
of
the
next
of
kin
because
he
dug
up
the
neolithic
skull
in
the
barrow
on
long
down
he
helps
to
keep
our
lives
from
being
monotonous
and
gives
a
little
comic
relief
where
it
is
badly
needed
and
now
having
brought
you
up
to
date
in
the
escaped
convict
the
stapletons
dr
mortimer
and
frankland
of
lafter
hall
let
me
end
on
that
which
is
most
important
and
tell
you
more
about
the
barrymores
and
especially
about
the
surprising
development
of
last
night
first
of
all
about
the
test
telegram
which
you
sent
from
london
in
order
to
make
sure
that
barrymore
was
really
here
i
have
already
explained
that
the
testimony
of
the
postmaster
shows
that
the
test
was
worthless
and
that
we
have
no
proof
one
way
or
the
other
i
told
sir
henry
how
the
matter
stood
and
he
at
once
in
his
downright
fashion
had
barrymore
up
and
asked
him
whether
he
had
received
the
telegram
himself
barrymore
said
that
he
had
did
the
boy
deliver
it
into
your
own
hands
asked
sir
henry
barrymore
looked
surprised
and
considered
for
a
little
time
no
said
he
i
was
in
the
box
room
at
the
time
and
my
wife
brought
it
up
to
me
did
you
answer
it
yourself
no
i
told
my
wife
what
to
answer
and
she
went
down
to
write
it
in
the
evening
he
recurred
to
the
subject
of
his
own
accord
i
could
not
quite
understand
the
object
of
your
questions
this
morning
sir
henry
said
he
i
trust
that
they
do
not
mean
that
i
have
done
anything
to
forfeit
your
confidence
sir
henry
had
to
assure
him
that
it
was
not
so
and
pacify
him
by
giving
him
a
considerable
part
of
his
old
wardrobe
the
london
outfit
having
now
all
arrived
mrs
barrymore
is
of
interest
to
me
she
is
a
heavy
solid
person
very
limited
intensely
respectable
and
inclined
to
be
puritanical
you
could
hardly
conceive
a
less
emotional
subject
yet
i
have
told
you
how
on
the
first
night
here
i
heard
her
sobbing
bitterly
and
since
then
i
have
more
than
once
observed
traces
of
tears
upon
her
face
some
deep
sorrow
gnaws
ever
at
her
heart
sometimes
i
wonder
if
she
has
a
guilty
memory
which
haunts
her
and
sometimes
i
suspect
barrymore
of
being
a
domestic
tyrant
i
have
always
felt
that
there
was
something
singular
and
questionable
in
this
mans
character
but
the
adventure
of
last
night
brings
all
my
suspicions
to
a
head
and
yet
it
may
seem
a
small
matter
in
itself
you
are
aware
that
i
am
not
a
very
sound
sleeper
and
since
i
have
been
on
guard
in
this
house
my
slumbers
have
been
lighter
than
ever
last
night
about
two
in
the
morning
i
was
aroused
by
a
stealthy
step
passing
my
room
i
rose
opened
my
door
and
peeped
out
a
long
black
shadow
was
trailing
down
the
corridor
it
was
thrown
by
a
man
who
walked
softly
down
the
passage
with
a
candle
held
in
his
hand
he
was
in
shirt
and
trousers
with
no
covering
to
his
feet
i
could
merely
see
the
outline
but
his
height
told
me
that
it
was
barrymore
he
walked
very
slowly
and
circumspectly
and
there
was
something
indescribably
guilty
and
furtive
in
his
whole
appearance
i
have
told
you
that
the
corridor
is
broken
by
the
balcony
which
runs
round
the
hall
but
that
it
is
resumed
upon
the
farther
side
i
waited
until
he
had
passed
out
of
sight
and
then
i
followed
him
when
i
came
round
the
balcony
he
had
reached
the
end
of
the
farther
corridor
and
i
could
see
from
the
glimmer
of
light
through
an
open
door
that
he
had
entered
one
of
the
rooms
now
all
these
rooms
are
unfurnished
and
unoccupied
so
that
his
expedition
became
more
mysterious
than
ever
the
light
shone
steadily
as
if
he
were
standing
motionless
i
crept
down
the
passage
as
noiselessly
as
i
could
and
peeped
round
the
corner
of
the
door
barrymore
was
crouching
at
the
window
with
the
candle
held
against
the
glass
his
profile
was
half
turned
towards
me
and
his
face
seemed
to
be
rigid
with
expectation
as
he
stared
out
into
the
blackness
of
the
moor
for
some
minutes
he
stood
watching
intently
then
he
gave
a
deep
groan
and
with
an
impatient
gesture
he
put
out
the
light
instantly
i
made
my
way
back
to
my
room
and
very
shortly
came
the
stealthy
steps
passing
once
more
upon
their
return
journey
long
afterwards
when
i
had
fallen
into
a
light
sleep
i
heard
a
key
turn
somewhere
in
a
lock
but
i
could
not
tell
whence
the
sound
came
what
it
all
means
i
cannot
guess
but
there
is
some
secret
business
going
on
in
this
house
of
gloom
which
sooner
or
later
we
shall
get
to
the
bottom
of
i
do
not
trouble
you
with
my
theories
for
you
asked
me
to
furnish
you
only
with
facts
i
have
had
a
long
talk
with
sir
henry
this
morning
and
we
have
made
a
plan
of
campaign
founded
upon
my
observations
of
last
night
i
will
not
speak
about
it
just
now
but
it
should
make
my
next
report
interesting
reading
chapter
the
light
upon
the
moor
second
report
of
dr
watson
baskerville
hall
oct
th
my
dear
holmes
if
i
was
compelled
to
leave
you
without
much
news
during
the
early
days
of
my
mission
you
must
acknowledge
that
i
am
making
up
for
lost
time
and
that
events
are
now
crowding
thick
and
fast
upon
us
in
my
last
report
i
ended
upon
my
top
note
with
barrymore
at
the
window
and
now
i
have
quite
a
budget
already
which
will
unless
i
am
much
mistaken
considerably
surprise
you
things
have
taken
a
turn
which
i
could
not
have
anticipated
in
some
ways
they
have
within
the
last
forty
eight
hours
become
much
clearer
and
in
some
ways
they
have
become
more
complicated
but
i
will
tell
you
all
and
you
shall
judge
for
yourself
before
breakfast
on
the
morning
following
my
adventure
i
went
down
the
corridor
and
examined
the
room
in
which
barrymore
had
been
on
the
night
before
the
western
window
through
which
he
had
stared
so
intently
has
i
noticed
one
peculiarity
above
all
other
windows
in
the
house
it
commands
the
nearest
outlook
on
to
the
moor
there
is
an
opening
between
two
trees
which
enables
one
from
this
point
of
view
to
look
right
down
upon
it
while
from
all
the
other
windows
it
is
only
a
distant
glimpse
which
can
be
obtained
it
follows
therefore
that
barrymore
since
only
this
window
would
serve
the
purpose
must
have
been
looking
out
for
something
or
somebody
upon
the
moor
the
night
was
very
dark
so
that
i
can
hardly
imagine
how
he
could
have
hoped
to
see
anyone
it
had
struck
me
that
it
was
possible
that
some
love
intrigue
was
on
foot
that
would
have
accounted
for
his
stealthy
movements
and
also
for
the
uneasiness
of
his
wife
the
man
is
a
striking
looking
fellow
very
well
equipped
to
steal
the
heart
of
a
country
girl
so
that
this
theory
seemed
to
have
something
to
support
it
that
opening
of
the
door
which
i
had
heard
after
i
had
returned
to
my
room
might
mean
that
he
had
gone
out
to
keep
some
clandestine
appointment
so
i
reasoned
with
myself
in
the
morning
and
i
tell
you
the
direction
of
my
suspicions
however
much
the
result
may
have
shown
that
they
were
unfounded
but
whatever
the
true
explanation
of
barrymores
movements
might
be
i
felt
that
the
responsibility
of
keeping
them
to
myself
until
i
could
explain
them
was
more
than
i
could
bear
i
had
an
interview
with
the
baronet
in
his
study
after
breakfast
and
i
told
him
all
that
i
had
seen
he
was
less
surprised
than
i
had
expected
i
knew
that
barrymore
walked
about
nights
and
i
had
a
mind
to
speak
to
him
about
it
said
he
two
or
three
times
i
have
heard
his
steps
in
the
passage
coming
and
going
just
about
the
hour
you
name
perhaps
then
he
pays
a
visit
every
night
to
that
particular
window
i
suggested
perhaps
he
does
if
so
we
should
be
able
to
shadow
him
and
see
what
it
is
that
he
is
after
i
wonder
what
your
friend
holmes
would
do
if
he
were
here
i
believe
that
he
would
do
exactly
what
you
now
suggest
said
i
he
would
follow
barrymore
and
see
what
he
did
then
we
shall
do
it
together
but
surely
he
would
hear
us
the
man
is
rather
deaf
and
in
any
case
we
must
take
our
chance
of
that
well
sit
up
in
my
room
tonight
and
wait
until
he
passes
sir
henry
rubbed
his
hands
with
pleasure
and
it
was
evident
that
he
hailed
the
adventure
as
a
relief
to
his
somewhat
quiet
life
upon
the
moor
the
baronet
has
been
in
communication
with
the
architect
who
prepared
the
plans
for
sir
charles
and
with
a
contractor
from
london
so
that
we
may
expect
great
changes
to
begin
here
soon
there
have
been
decorators
and
furnishers
up
from
plymouth
and
it
is
evident
that
our
friend
has
large
ideas
and
means
to
spare
no
pains
or
expense
to
restore
the
grandeur
of
his
family
when
the
house
is
renovated
and
refurnished
all
that
he
will
need
will
be
a
wife
to
make
it
complete
between
ourselves
there
are
pretty
clear
signs
that
this
will
not
be
wanting
if
the
lady
is
willing
for
i
have
seldom
seen
a
man
more
infatuated
with
a
woman
than
he
is
with
our
beautiful
neighbour
miss
stapleton
and
yet
the
course
of
true
love
does
not
run
quite
as
smoothly
as
one
would
under
the
circumstances
expect
today
for
example
its
surface
was
broken
by
a
very
unexpected
ripple
which
has
caused
our
friend
considerable
perplexity
and
annoyance
after
the
conversation
which
i
have
quoted
about
barrymore
sir
henry
put
on
his
hat
and
prepared
to
go
out
as
a
matter
of
course
i
did
the
same
what
are
you
coming
watson
he
asked
looking
at
me
in
a
curious
way
that
depends
on
whether
you
are
going
on
the
moor
said
i
yes
i
am
well
you
know
what
my
instructions
are
i
am
sorry
to
intrude
but
you
heard
how
earnestly
holmes
insisted
that
i
should
not
leave
you
and
especially
that
you
should
not
go
alone
upon
the
moor
sir
henry
put
his
hand
upon
my
shoulder
with
a
pleasant
smile
my
dear
fellow
said
he
holmes
with
all
his
wisdom
did
not
foresee
some
things
which
have
happened
since
i
have
been
on
the
moor
you
understand
me
i
am
sure
that
you
are
the
last
man
in
the
world
who
would
wish
to
be
a
spoil
sport
i
must
go
out
alone
it
put
me
in
a
most
awkward
position
i
was
at
a
loss
what
to
say
or
what
to
do
and
before
i
had
made
up
my
mind
he
picked
up
his
cane
and
was
gone
but
when
i
came
to
think
the
matter
over
my
conscience
reproached
me
bitterly
for
having
on
any
pretext
allowed
him
to
go
out
of
my
sight
i
imagined
what
my
feelings
would
be
if
i
had
to
return
to
you
and
to
confess
that
some
misfortune
had
occurred
through
my
disregard
for
your
instructions
i
assure
you
my
cheeks
flushed
at
the
very
thought
it
might
not
even
now
be
too
late
to
overtake
him
so
i
set
off
at
once
in
the
direction
of
merripit
house
i
hurried
along
the
road
at
the
top
of
my
speed
without
seeing
anything
of
sir
henry
until
i
came
to
the
point
where
the
moor
path
branches
off
there
fearing
that
perhaps
i
had
come
in
the
wrong
direction
after
all
i
mounted
a
hill
from
which
i
could
command
a
view
the
same
hill
which
is
cut
into
the
dark
quarry
thence
i
saw
him
at
once
he
was
on
the
moor
path
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
off
and
a
lady
was
by
his
side
who
could
only
be
miss
stapleton
it
was
clear
that
there
was
already
an
understanding
between
them
and
that
they
had
met
by
appointment
they
were
walking
slowly
along
in
deep
conversation
and
i
saw
her
making
quick
little
movements
of
her
hands
as
if
she
were
very
earnest
in
what
she
was
saying
while
he
listened
intently
and
once
or
twice
shook
his
head
in
strong
dissent
i
stood
among
the
rocks
watching
them
very
much
puzzled
as
to
what
i
should
do
next
to
follow
them
and
break
into
their
intimate
conversation
seemed
to
be
an
outrage
and
yet
my
clear
duty
was
never
for
an
instant
to
let
him
out
of
my
sight
to
act
the
spy
upon
a
friend
was
a
hateful
task
still
i
could
see
no
better
course
than
to
observe
him
from
the
hill
and
to
clear
my
conscience
by
confessing
to
him
afterwards
what
i
had
done
it
is
true
that
if
any
sudden
danger
had
threatened
him
i
was
too
far
away
to
be
of
use
and
yet
i
am
sure
that
you
will
agree
with
me
that
the
position
was
very
difficult
and
that
there
was
nothing
more
which
i
could
do
our
friend
sir
henry
and
the
lady
had
halted
on
the
path
and
were
standing
deeply
absorbed
in
their
conversation
when
i
was
suddenly
aware
that
i
was
not
the
only
witness
of
their
interview
a
wisp
of
green
floating
in
the
air
caught
my
eye
and
another
glance
showed
me
that
it
was
carried
on
a
stick
by
a
man
who
was
moving
among
the
broken
ground
it
was
stapleton
with
his
butterfly
net
he
was
very
much
closer
to
the
pair
than
i
was
and
he
appeared
to
be
moving
in
their
direction
at
this
instant
sir
henry
suddenly
drew
miss
stapleton
to
his
side
his
arm
was
round
her
but
it
seemed
to
me
that
she
was
straining
away
from
him
with
her
face
averted
he
stooped
his
head
to
hers
and
she
raised
one
hand
as
if
in
protest
next
moment
i
saw
them
spring
apart
and
turn
hurriedly
round
stapleton
was
the
cause
of
the
interruption
he
was
running
wildly
towards
them
his
absurd
net
dangling
behind
him
he
gesticulated
and
almost
danced
with
excitement
in
front
of
the
lovers
what
the
scene
meant
i
could
not
imagine
but
it
seemed
to
me
that
stapleton
was
abusing
sir
henry
who
offered
explanations
which
became
more
angry
as
the
other
refused
to
accept
them
the
lady
stood
by
in
haughty
silence
finally
stapleton
turned
upon
his
heel
and
beckoned
in
a
peremptory
way
to
his
sister
who
after
an
irresolute
glance
at
sir
henry
walked
off
by
the
side
of
her
brother
the
naturalists
angry
gestures
showed
that
the
lady
was
included
in
his
displeasure
the
baronet
stood
for
a
minute
looking
after
them
and
then
he
walked
slowly
back
the
way
that
he
had
come
his
head
hanging
the
very
picture
of
dejection
what
all
this
meant
i
could
not
imagine
but
i
was
deeply
ashamed
to
have
witnessed
so
intimate
a
scene
without
my
friends
knowledge
i
ran
down
the
hill
therefore
and
met
the
baronet
at
the
bottom
his
face
was
flushed
with
anger
and
his
brows
were
wrinkled
like
one
who
is
at
his
wits
ends
what
to
do
halloa
watson
where
have
you
dropped
from
said
he
you
dont
mean
to
say
that
you
came
after
me
in
spite
of
all
i
explained
everything
to
him
how
i
had
found
it
impossible
to
remain
behind
how
i
had
followed
him
and
how
i
had
witnessed
all
that
had
occurred
for
an
instant
his
eyes
blazed
at
me
but
my
frankness
disarmed
his
anger
and
he
broke
at
last
into
a
rather
rueful
laugh
you
would
have
thought
the
middle
of
that
prairie
a
fairly
safe
place
for
a
man
to
be
private
said
he
but
by
thunder
the
whole
countryside
seems
to
have
been
out
to
see
me
do
my
wooing
and
a
mighty
poor
wooing
at
that
where
had
you
engaged
a
seat
i
was
on
that
hill
quite
in
the
back
row
eh
but
her
brother
was
well
up
to
the
front
did
you
see
him
come
out
on
us
yes
i
did
did
he
ever
strike
you
as
being
crazy
this
brother
of
hers
i
cant
say
that
he
ever
did
i
dare
say
not
i
always
thought
him
sane
enough
until
today
but
you
can
take
it
from
me
that
either
he
or
i
ought
to
be
in
a
straitjacket
whats
the
matter
with
me
anyhow
youve
lived
near
me
for
some
weeks
watson
tell
me
straight
now
is
there
anything
that
would
prevent
me
from
making
a
good
husband
to
a
woman
that
i
loved
i
should
say
not
he
cant
object
to
my
worldly
position
so
it
must
be
myself
that
he
has
this
down
on
what
has
he
against
me
i
never
hurt
man
or
woman
in
my
life
that
i
know
of
and
yet
he
would
not
so
much
as
let
me
touch
the
tips
of
her
fingers
did
he
say
so
that
and
a
deal
more
i
tell
you
watson
ive
only
known
her
these
few
weeks
but
from
the
first
i
just
felt
that
she
was
made
for
me
and
she
too
she
was
happy
when
she
was
with
me
and
that
ill
swear
theres
a
light
in
a
womans
eyes
that
speaks
louder
than
words
but
he
has
never
let
us
get
together
and
it
was
only
today
for
the
first
time
that
i
saw
a
chance
of
having
a
few
words
with
her
alone
she
was
glad
to
meet
me
but
when
she
did
it
was
not
love
that
she
would
talk
about
and
she
wouldnt
have
let
me
talk
about
it
either
if
she
could
have
stopped
it
she
kept
coming
back
to
it
that
this
was
a
place
of
danger
and
that
she
would
never
be
happy
until
i
had
left
it
i
told
her
that
since
i
had
seen
her
i
was
in
no
hurry
to
leave
it
and
that
if
she
really
wanted
me
to
go
the
only
way
to
work
it
was
for
her
to
arrange
to
go
with
me
with
that
i
offered
in
as
many
words
to
marry
her
but
before
she
could
answer
down
came
this
brother
of
hers
running
at
us
with
a
face
on
him
like
a
madman
he
was
just
white
with
rage
and
those
light
eyes
of
his
were
blazing
with
fury
what
was
i
doing
with
the
lady
how
dared
i
offer
her
attentions
which
were
distasteful
to
her
did
i
think
that
because
i
was
a
baronet
i
could
do
what
i
liked
if
he
had
not
been
her
brother
i
should
have
known
better
how
to
answer
him
as
it
was
i
told
him
that
my
feelings
towards
his
sister
were
such
as
i
was
not
ashamed
of
and
that
i
hoped
that
she
might
honour
me
by
becoming
my
wife
that
seemed
to
make
the
matter
no
better
so
then
i
lost
my
temper
too
and
i
answered
him
rather
more
hotly
than
i
should
perhaps
considering
that
she
was
standing
by
so
it
ended
by
his
going
off
with
her
as
you
saw
and
here
am
i
as
badly
puzzled
a
man
as
any
in
this
county
just
tell
me
what
it
all
means
watson
and
ill
owe
you
more
than
ever
i
can
hope
to
pay
i
tried
one
or
two
explanations
but
indeed
i
was
completely
puzzled
myself
our
friends
title
his
fortune
his
age
his
character
and
his
appearance
are
all
in
his
favour
and
i
know
nothing
against
him
unless
it
be
this
dark
fate
which
runs
in
his
family
that
his
advances
should
be
rejected
so
brusquely
without
any
reference
to
the
ladys
own
wishes
and
that
the
lady
should
accept
the
situation
without
protest
is
very
amazing
however
our
conjectures
were
set
at
rest
by
a
visit
from
stapleton
himself
that
very
afternoon
he
had
come
to
offer
apologies
for
his
rudeness
of
the
morning
and
after
a
long
private
interview
with
sir
henry
in
his
study
the
upshot
of
their
conversation
was
that
the
breach
is
quite
healed
and
that
we
are
to
dine
at
merripit
house
next
friday
as
a
sign
of
it
i
dont
say
now
that
he
isnt
a
crazy
man
said
sir
henry
i
cant
forget
the
look
in
his
eyes
when
he
ran
at
me
this
morning
but
i
must
allow
that
no
man
could
make
a
more
handsome
apology
than
he
has
done
did
he
give
any
explanation
of
his
conduct
his
sister
is
everything
in
his
life
he
says
that
is
natural
enough
and
i
am
glad
that
he
should
understand
her
value
they
have
always
been
together
and
according
to
his
account
he
has
been
a
very
lonely
man
with
only
her
as
a
companion
so
that
the
thought
of
losing
her
was
really
terrible
to
him
he
had
not
understood
he
said
that
i
was
becoming
attached
to
her
but
when
he
saw
with
his
own
eyes
that
it
was
really
so
and
that
she
might
be
taken
away
from
him
it
gave
him
such
a
shock
that
for
a
time
he
was
not
responsible
for
what
he
said
or
did
he
was
very
sorry
for
all
that
had
passed
and
he
recognized
how
foolish
and
how
selfish
it
was
that
he
should
imagine
that
he
could
hold
a
beautiful
woman
like
his
sister
to
himself
for
her
whole
life
if
she
had
to
leave
him
he
had
rather
it
was
to
a
neighbour
like
myself
than
to
anyone
else
but
in
any
case
it
was
a
blow
to
him
and
it
would
take
him
some
time
before
he
could
prepare
himself
to
meet
it
he
would
withdraw
all
opposition
upon
his
part
if
i
would
promise
for
three
months
to
let
the
matter
rest
and
to
be
content
with
cultivating
the
ladys
friendship
during
that
time
without
claiming
her
love
this
i
promised
and
so
the
matter
rests
so
there
is
one
of
our
small
mysteries
cleared
up
it
is
something
to
have
touched
bottom
anywhere
in
this
bog
in
which
we
are
floundering
we
know
now
why
stapleton
looked
with
disfavour
upon
his
sister
suitor
even
when
that
suitor
was
so
eligible
a
one
as
sir
henry
and
now
i
pass
on
to
another
thread
which
i
have
extricated
out
of
the
tangled
skein
the
mystery
of
the
sobs
in
the
night
of
the
tear
stained
face
of
mrs
barrymore
of
the
secret
journey
of
the
butler
to
the
western
lattice
window
congratulate
me
my
dear
holmes
and
tell
me
that
i
have
not
disappointed
you
as
an
agent
that
you
do
not
regret
the
confidence
which
you
showed
in
me
when
you
sent
me
down
all
these
things
have
by
one
nights
work
been
thoroughly
cleared
i
have
said
by
one
nights
work
but
in
truth
it
was
by
two
nights
work
for
on
the
first
we
drew
entirely
blank
i
sat
up
with
sir
henry
in
his
rooms
until
nearly
three
oclock
in
the
morning
but
no
sound
of
any
sort
did
we
hear
except
the
chiming
clock
upon
the
stairs
it
was
a
most
melancholy
vigil
and
ended
by
each
of
us
falling
asleep
in
our
chairs
fortunately
we
were
not
discouraged
and
we
determined
to
try
again
the
next
night
we
lowered
the
lamp
and
sat
smoking
cigarettes
without
making
the
least
sound
it
was
incredible
how
slowly
the
hours
crawled
by
and
yet
we
were
helped
through
it
by
the
same
sort
of
patient
interest
which
the
hunter
must
feel
as
he
watches
the
trap
into
which
he
hopes
the
game
may
wander
one
struck
and
two
and
we
had
almost
for
the
second
time
given
it
up
in
despair
when
in
an
instant
we
both
sat
bolt
upright
in
our
chairs
with
all
our
weary
senses
keenly
on
the
alert
once
more
we
had
heard
the
creak
of
a
step
in
the
passage
very
stealthily
we
heard
it
pass
along
until
it
died
away
in
the
distance
then
the
baronet
gently
opened
his
door
and
we
set
out
in
pursuit
already
our
man
had
gone
round
the
gallery
and
the
corridor
was
all
in
darkness
softly
we
stole
along
until
we
had
come
into
the
other
wing
we
were
just
in
time
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
tall
black
bearded
figure
his
shoulders
rounded
as
he
tiptoed
down
the
passage
then
he
passed
through
the
same
door
as
before
and
the
light
of
the
candle
framed
it
in
the
darkness
and
shot
one
single
yellow
beam
across
the
gloom
of
the
corridor
we
shuffled
cautiously
towards
it
trying
every
plank
before
we
dared
to
put
our
whole
weight
upon
it
we
had
taken
the
precaution
of
leaving
our
boots
behind
us
but
even
so
the
old
boards
snapped
and
creaked
beneath
our
tread
sometimes
it
seemed
impossible
that
he
should
fail
to
hear
our
approach
however
the
man
is
fortunately
rather
deaf
and
he
was
entirely
preoccupied
in
that
which
he
was
doing
when
at
last
we
reached
the
door
and
peeped
through
we
found
him
crouching
at
the
window
candle
in
hand
his
white
intent
face
pressed
against
the
pane
exactly
as
i
had
seen
him
two
nights
before
we
had
arranged
no
plan
of
campaign
but
the
baronet
is
a
man
to
whom
the
most
direct
way
is
always
the
most
natural
he
walked
into
the
room
and
as
he
did
so
barrymore
sprang
up
from
the
window
with
a
sharp
hiss
of
his
breath
and
stood
livid
and
trembling
before
us
his
dark
eyes
glaring
out
of
the
white
mask
of
his
face
were
full
of
horror
and
astonishment
as
he
gazed
from
sir
henry
to
me
what
are
you
doing
here
barrymore
nothing
sir
his
agitation
was
so
great
that
he
could
hardly
speak
and
the
shadows
sprang
up
and
down
from
the
shaking
of
his
candle
it
was
the
window
sir
i
go
round
at
night
to
see
that
they
are
fastened
on
the
second
floor
yes
sir
all
the
windows
look
here
barrymore
said
sir
henry
sternly
we
have
made
up
our
minds
to
have
the
truth
out
of
you
so
it
will
save
you
trouble
to
tell
it
sooner
rather
than
later
come
now
no
lies
what
were
you
doing
at
that
window
the
fellow
looked
at
us
in
a
helpless
way
and
he
wrung
his
hands
together
like
one
who
is
in
the
last
extremity
of
doubt
and
misery
i
was
doing
no
harm
sir
i
was
holding
a
candle
to
the
window
and
why
were
you
holding
a
candle
to
the
window
dont
ask
me
sir
henry
dont
ask
me
i
give
you
my
word
sir
that
it
is
not
my
secret
and
that
i
cannot
tell
it
if
it
concerned
no
one
but
myself
i
would
not
try
to
keep
it
from
you
a
sudden
idea
occurred
to
me
and
i
took
the
candle
from
the
trembling
hand
of
the
butler
he
must
have
been
holding
it
as
a
signal
said
i
let
us
see
if
there
is
any
answer
i
held
it
as
he
had
done
and
stared
out
into
the
darkness
of
the
night
vaguely
i
could
discern
the
black
bank
of
the
trees
and
the
lighter
expanse
of
the
moor
for
the
moon
was
behind
the
clouds
and
then
i
gave
a
cry
of
exultation
for
a
tiny
pinpoint
of
yellow
light
had
suddenly
transfixed
the
dark
veil
and
glowed
steadily
in
the
centre
of
the
black
square
framed
by
the
window
there
it
is
i
cried
no
no
sir
it
is
nothing
nothing
at
all
the
butler
broke
in
i
assure
you
sir
move
your
light
across
the
window
watson
cried
the
baronet
see
the
other
moves
also
now
you
rascal
do
you
deny
that
it
is
a
signal
come
speak
up
who
is
your
confederate
out
yonder
and
what
is
this
conspiracy
that
is
going
on
the
mans
face
became
openly
defiant
it
is
my
business
and
not
yours
i
will
not
tell
then
you
leave
my
employment
right
away
very
good
sir
if
i
must
i
must
and
you
go
in
disgrace
by
thunder
you
may
well
be
ashamed
of
yourself
your
family
has
lived
with
mine
for
over
a
hundred
years
under
this
roof
and
here
i
find
you
deep
in
some
dark
plot
against
me
no
no
sir
no
not
against
you
it
was
a
womans
voice
and
mrs
barrymore
paler
and
more
horror
struck
than
her
husband
was
standing
at
the
door
her
bulky
figure
in
a
shawl
and
skirt
might
have
been
comic
were
it
not
for
the
intensity
of
feeling
upon
her
face
we
have
to
go
eliza
this
is
the
end
of
it
you
can
pack
our
things
said
the
butler
oh
john
john
have
i
brought
you
to
this
it
is
my
doing
sir
henry
all
mine
he
has
done
nothing
except
for
my
sake
and
because
i
asked
him
speak
out
then
what
does
it
mean
my
unhappy
brother
is
starving
on
the
moor
we
cannot
let
him
perish
at
our
very
gates
the
light
is
a
signal
to
him
that
food
is
ready
for
him
and
his
light
out
yonder
is
to
show
the
spot
to
which
to
bring
it
then
your
brother
is
the
escaped
convict
sir
selden
the
criminal
thats
the
truth
sir
said
barrymore
i
said
that
it
was
not
my
secret
and
that
i
could
not
tell
it
to
you
but
now
you
have
heard
it
and
you
will
see
that
if
there
was
a
plot
it
was
not
against
you
this
then
was
the
explanation
of
the
stealthy
expeditions
at
night
and
the
light
at
the
window
sir
henry
and
i
both
stared
at
the
woman
in
amazement
was
it
possible
that
this
stolidly
respectable
person
was
of
the
same
blood
as
one
of
the
most
notorious
criminals
in
the
country
yes
sir
my
name
was
selden
and
he
is
my
younger
brother
we
humoured
him
too
much
when
he
was
a
lad
and
gave
him
his
own
way
in
everything
until
he
came
to
think
that
the
world
was
made
for
his
pleasure
and
that
he
could
do
what
he
liked
in
it
then
as
he
grew
older
he
met
wicked
companions
and
the
devil
entered
into
him
until
he
broke
my
mothers
heart
and
dragged
our
name
in
the
dirt
from
crime
to
crime
he
sank
lower
and
lower
until
it
is
only
the
mercy
of
god
which
has
snatched
him
from
the
scaffold
but
to
me
sir
he
was
always
the
little
curly
headed
boy
that
i
had
nursed
and
played
with
as
an
elder
sister
would
that
was
why
he
broke
prison
sir
he
knew
that
i
was
here
and
that
we
could
not
refuse
to
help
him
when
he
dragged
himself
here
one
night
weary
and
starving
with
the
warders
hard
at
his
heels
what
could
we
do
we
took
him
in
and
fed
him
and
cared
for
him
then
you
returned
sir
and
my
brother
thought
he
would
be
safer
on
the
moor
than
anywhere
else
until
the
hue
and
cry
was
over
so
he
lay
in
hiding
there
but
every
second
night
we
made
sure
if
he
was
still
there
by
putting
a
light
in
the
window
and
if
there
was
an
answer
my
husband
took
out
some
bread
and
meat
to
him
every
day
we
hoped
that
he
was
gone
but
as
long
as
he
was
there
we
could
not
desert
him
that
is
the
whole
truth
as
i
am
an
honest
christian
woman
and
you
will
see
that
if
there
is
blame
in
the
matter
it
does
not
lie
with
my
husband
but
with
me
for
whose
sake
he
has
done
all
that
he
has
the
womans
words
came
with
an
intense
earnestness
which
carried
conviction
with
them
is
this
true
barrymore
yes
sir
henry
every
word
of
it
well
i
cannot
blame
you
for
standing
by
your
own
wife
forget
what
i
have
said
go
to
your
room
you
two
and
we
shall
talk
further
about
this
matter
in
the
morning
when
they
were
gone
we
looked
out
of
the
window
again
sir
henry
had
flung
it
open
and
the
cold
night
wind
beat
in
upon
our
faces
far
away
in
the
black
distance
there
still
glowed
that
one
tiny
point
of
yellow
light
i
wonder
he
dares
said
sir
henry
it
may
be
so
placed
as
to
be
only
visible
from
here
very
likely
how
far
do
you
think
it
is
out
by
the
cleft
tor
i
think
not
more
than
a
mile
or
two
off
hardly
that
well
it
cannot
be
far
if
barrymore
had
to
carry
out
the
food
to
it
and
he
is
waiting
this
villain
beside
that
candle
by
thunder
watson
i
am
going
out
to
take
that
man
the
same
thought
had
crossed
my
own
mind
it
was
not
as
if
the
barrymores
had
taken
us
into
their
confidence
their
secret
had
been
forced
from
them
the
man
was
a
danger
to
the
community
an
unmitigated
scoundrel
for
whom
there
was
neither
pity
nor
excuse
we
were
only
doing
our
duty
in
taking
this
chance
of
putting
him
back
where
he
could
do
no
harm
with
his
brutal
and
violent
nature
others
would
have
to
pay
the
price
if
we
held
our
hands
any
night
for
example
our
neighbours
the
stapletons
might
be
attacked
by
him
and
it
may
have
been
the
thought
of
this
which
made
sir
henry
so
keen
upon
the
adventure
i
will
come
said
i
then
get
your
revolver
and
put
on
your
boots
the
sooner
we
start
the
better
as
the
fellow
may
put
out
his
light
and
be
off
in
five
minutes
we
were
outside
the
door
starting
upon
our
expedition
we
hurried
through
the
dark
shrubbery
amid
the
dull
moaning
of
the
autumn
wind
and
the
rustle
of
the
falling
leaves
the
night
air
was
heavy
with
the
smell
of
damp
and
decay
now
and
again
the
moon
peeped
out
for
an
instant
but
clouds
were
driving
over
the
face
of
the
sky
and
just
as
we
came
out
on
the
moor
a
thin
rain
began
to
fall
the
light
still
burned
steadily
in
front
are
you
armed
i
asked
i
have
a
hunting
crop
we
must
close
in
on
him
rapidly
for
he
is
said
to
be
a
desperate
fellow
we
shall
take
him
by
surprise
and
have
him
at
our
mercy
before
he
can
resist
i
say
watson
said
the
baronet
what
would
holmes
say
to
this
how
about
that
hour
of
darkness
in
which
the
power
of
evil
is
exalted
as
if
in
answer
to
his
words
there
rose
suddenly
out
of
the
vast
gloom
of
the
moor
that
strange
cry
which
i
had
already
heard
upon
the
borders
of
the
great
grimpen
mire
it
came
with
the
wind
through
the
silence
of
the
night
a
long
deep
mutter
then
a
rising
howl
and
then
the
sad
moan
in
which
it
died
away
again
and
again
it
sounded
the
whole
air
throbbing
with
it
strident
wild
and
menacing
the
baronet
caught
my
sleeve
and
his
face
glimmered
white
through
the
darkness
my
god
whats
that
watson
i
dont
know
its
a
sound
they
have
on
the
moor
i
heard
it
once
before
it
died
away
and
an
absolute
silence
closed
in
upon
us
we
stood
straining
our
ears
but
nothing
came
watson
said
the
baronet
it
was
the
cry
of
a
hound
my
blood
ran
cold
in
my
veins
for
there
was
a
break
in
his
voice
which
told
of
the
sudden
horror
which
had
seized
him
what
do
they
call
this
sound
he
asked
who
the
folk
on
the
countryside
oh
they
are
ignorant
people
why
should
you
mind
what
they
call
it
tell
me
watson
what
do
they
say
of
it
i
hesitated
but
could
not
escape
the
question
they
say
it
is
the
cry
of
the
hound
of
the
baskervilles
he
groaned
and
was
silent
for
a
few
moments
a
hound
it
was
he
said
at
last
but
it
seemed
to
come
from
miles
away
over
yonder
i
think
it
was
hard
to
say
whence
it
came
it
rose
and
fell
with
the
wind
isnt
that
the
direction
of
the
great
grimpen
mire
yes
it
is
well
it
was
up
there
come
now
watson
didnt
you
think
yourself
that
it
was
the
cry
of
a
hound
i
am
not
a
child
you
need
not
fear
to
speak
the
truth
stapleton
was
with
me
when
i
heard
it
last
he
said
that
it
might
be
the
calling
of
a
strange
bird
no
no
it
was
a
hound
my
god
can
there
be
some
truth
in
all
these
stories
is
it
possible
that
i
am
really
in
danger
from
so
dark
a
cause
you
dont
believe
it
do
you
watson
no
no
and
yet
it
was
one
thing
to
laugh
about
it
in
london
and
it
is
another
to
stand
out
here
in
the
darkness
of
the
moor
and
to
hear
such
a
cry
as
that
and
my
uncle
there
was
the
footprint
of
the
hound
beside
him
as
he
lay
it
all
fits
together
i
dont
think
that
i
am
a
coward
watson
but
that
sound
seemed
to
freeze
my
very
blood
feel
my
hand
it
was
as
cold
as
a
block
of
marble
youll
be
all
right
tomorrow
i
dont
think
ill
get
that
cry
out
of
my
head
what
do
you
advise
that
we
do
now
shall
we
turn
back
no
by
thunder
we
have
come
out
to
get
our
man
and
we
will
do
it
we
after
the
convict
and
a
hell
hound
as
likely
as
not
after
us
come
on
well
see
it
through
if
all
the
fiends
of
the
pit
were
loose
upon
the
moor
we
stumbled
slowly
along
in
the
darkness
with
the
black
loom
of
the
craggy
hills
around
us
and
the
yellow
speck
of
light
burning
steadily
in
front
there
is
nothing
so
deceptive
as
the
distance
of
a
light
upon
a
pitch
dark
night
and
sometimes
the
glimmer
seemed
to
be
far
away
upon
the
horizon
and
sometimes
it
might
have
been
within
a
few
yards
of
us
but
at
last
we
could
see
whence
it
came
and
then
we
knew
that
we
were
indeed
very
close
a
guttering
candle
was
stuck
in
a
crevice
of
the
rocks
which
flanked
it
on
each
side
so
as
to
keep
the
wind
from
it
and
also
to
prevent
it
from
being
visible
save
in
the
direction
of
baskerville
hall
a
boulder
of
granite
concealed
our
approach
and
crouching
behind
it
we
gazed
over
it
at
the
signal
light
it
was
strange
to
see
this
single
candle
burning
there
in
the
middle
of
the
moor
with
no
sign
of
life
near
it
just
the
one
straight
yellow
flame
and
the
gleam
of
the
rock
on
each
side
of
it
what
shall
we
do
now
whispered
sir
henry
wait
here
he
must
be
near
his
light
let
us
see
if
we
can
get
a
glimpse
of
him
the
words
were
hardly
out
of
my
mouth
when
we
both
saw
him
over
the
rocks
in
the
crevice
of
which
the
candle
burned
there
was
thrust
out
an
evil
yellow
face
a
terrible
animal
face
all
seamed
and
scored
with
vile
passions
foul
with
mire
with
a
bristling
beard
and
hung
with
matted
hair
it
might
well
have
belonged
to
one
of
those
old
savages
who
dwelt
in
the
burrows
on
the
hillsides
the
light
beneath
him
was
reflected
in
his
small
cunning
eyes
which
peered
fiercely
to
right
and
left
through
the
darkness
like
a
crafty
and
savage
animal
who
has
heard
the
steps
of
the
hunters
something
had
evidently
aroused
his
suspicions
it
may
have
been
that
barrymore
had
some
private
signal
which
we
had
neglected
to
give
or
the
fellow
may
have
had
some
other
reason
for
thinking
that
all
was
not
well
but
i
could
read
his
fears
upon
his
wicked
face
any
instant
he
might
dash
out
the
light
and
vanish
in
the
darkness
i
sprang
forward
therefore
and
sir
henry
did
the
same
at
the
same
moment
the
convict
screamed
out
a
curse
at
us
and
hurled
a
rock
which
splintered
up
against
the
boulder
which
had
sheltered
us
i
caught
one
glimpse
of
his
short
squat
strongly
built
figure
as
he
sprang
to
his
feet
and
turned
to
run
at
the
same
moment
by
a
lucky
chance
the
moon
broke
through
the
clouds
we
rushed
over
the
brow
of
the
hill
and
there
was
our
man
running
with
great
speed
down
the
other
side
springing
over
the
stones
in
his
way
with
the
activity
of
a
mountain
goat
a
lucky
long
shot
of
my
revolver
might
have
crippled
him
but
i
had
brought
it
only
to
defend
myself
if
attacked
and
not
to
shoot
an
unarmed
man
who
was
running
away
we
were
both
swift
runners
and
in
fairly
good
training
but
we
soon
found
that
we
had
no
chance
of
overtaking
him
we
saw
him
for
a
long
time
in
the
moonlight
until
he
was
only
a
small
speck
moving
swiftly
among
the
boulders
upon
the
side
of
a
distant
hill
we
ran
and
ran
until
we
were
completely
blown
but
the
space
between
us
grew
ever
wider
finally
we
stopped
and
sat
panting
on
two
rocks
while
we
watched
him
disappearing
in
the
distance
and
it
was
at
this
moment
that
there
occurred
a
most
strange
and
unexpected
thing
we
had
risen
from
our
rocks
and
were
turning
to
go
home
having
abandoned
the
hopeless
chase
the
moon
was
low
upon
the
right
and
the
jagged
pinnacle
of
a
granite
tor
stood
up
against
the
lower
curve
of
its
silver
disc
there
outlined
as
black
as
an
ebony
statue
on
that
shining
background
i
saw
the
figure
of
a
man
upon
the
tor
do
not
think
that
it
was
a
delusion
holmes
i
assure
you
that
i
have
never
in
my
life
seen
anything
more
clearly
as
far
as
i
could
judge
the
figure
was
that
of
a
tall
thin
man
he
stood
with
his
legs
a
little
separated
his
arms
folded
his
head
bowed
as
if
he
were
brooding
over
that
enormous
wilderness
of
peat
and
granite
which
lay
before
him
he
might
have
been
the
very
spirit
of
that
terrible
place
it
was
not
the
convict
this
man
was
far
from
the
place
where
the
latter
had
disappeared
besides
he
was
a
much
taller
man
with
a
cry
of
surprise
i
pointed
him
out
to
the
baronet
but
in
the
instant
during
which
i
had
turned
to
grasp
his
arm
the
man
was
gone
there
was
the
sharp
pinnacle
of
granite
still
cutting
the
lower
edge
of
the
moon
but
its
peak
bore
no
trace
of
that
silent
and
motionless
figure
i
wished
to
go
in
that
direction
and
to
search
the
tor
but
it
was
some
distance
away
the
baronets
nerves
were
still
quivering
from
that
cry
which
recalled
the
dark
story
of
his
family
and
he
was
not
in
the
mood
for
fresh
adventures
he
had
not
seen
this
lonely
man
upon
the
tor
and
could
not
feel
the
thrill
which
his
strange
presence
and
his
commanding
attitude
had
given
to
me
a
warder
no
doubt
said
he
the
moor
has
been
thick
with
them
since
this
fellow
escaped
well
perhaps
his
explanation
may
be
the
right
one
but
i
should
like
to
have
some
further
proof
of
it
today
we
mean
to
communicate
to
the
princetown
people
where
they
should
look
for
their
missing
man
but
it
is
hard
lines
that
we
have
not
actually
had
the
triumph
of
bringing
him
back
as
our
own
prisoner
such
are
the
adventures
of
last
night
and
you
must
acknowledge
my
dear
holmes
that
i
have
done
you
very
well
in
the
matter
of
a
report
much
of
what
i
tell
you
is
no
doubt
quite
irrelevant
but
still
i
feel
that
it
is
best
that
i
should
let
you
have
all
the
facts
and
leave
you
to
select
for
yourself
those
which
will
be
of
most
service
to
you
in
helping
you
to
your
conclusions
we
are
certainly
making
some
progress
so
far
as
the
barrymores
go
we
have
found
the
motive
of
their
actions
and
that
has
cleared
up
the
situation
very
much
but
the
moor
with
its
mysteries
and
its
strange
inhabitants
remains
as
inscrutable
as
ever
perhaps
in
my
next
i
may
be
able
to
throw
some
light
upon
this
also
best
of
all
would
it
be
if
you
could
come
down
to
us
in
any
case
you
will
hear
from
me
again
in
the
course
of
the
next
few
days
chapter
extract
from
the
diary
of
dr
watson
so
far
i
have
been
able
to
quote
from
the
reports
which
i
have
forwarded
during
these
early
days
to
sherlock
holmes
now
however
i
have
arrived
at
a
point
in
my
narrative
where
i
am
compelled
to
abandon
this
method
and
to
trust
once
more
to
my
recollections
aided
by
the
diary
which
i
kept
at
the
time
a
few
extracts
from
the
latter
will
carry
me
on
to
those
scenes
which
are
indelibly
fixed
in
every
detail
upon
my
memory
i
proceed
then
from
the
morning
which
followed
our
abortive
chase
of
the
convict
and
our
other
strange
experiences
upon
the
moor
october
th
a
dull
and
foggy
day
with
a
drizzle
of
rain
the
house
is
banked
in
with
rolling
clouds
which
rise
now
and
then
to
show
the
dreary
curves
of
the
moor
with
thin
silver
veins
upon
the
sides
of
the
hills
and
the
distant
boulders
gleaming
where
the
light
strikes
upon
their
wet
faces
it
is
melancholy
outside
and
in
the
baronet
is
in
a
black
reaction
after
the
excitements
of
the
night
i
am
conscious
myself
of
a
weight
at
my
heart
and
a
feeling
of
impending
danger
ever
present
danger
which
is
the
more
terrible
because
i
am
unable
to
define
it
and
have
i
not
cause
for
such
a
feeling
consider
the
long
sequence
of
incidents
which
have
all
pointed
to
some
sinister
influence
which
is
at
work
around
us
there
is
the
death
of
the
last
occupant
of
the
hall
fulfilling
so
exactly
the
conditions
of
the
family
legend
and
there
are
the
repeated
reports
from
peasants
of
the
appearance
of
a
strange
creature
upon
the
moor
twice
i
have
with
my
own
ears
heard
the
sound
which
resembled
the
distant
baying
of
a
hound
it
is
incredible
impossible
that
it
should
really
be
outside
the
ordinary
laws
of
nature
a
spectral
hound
which
leaves
material
footmarks
and
fills
the
air
with
its
howling
is
surely
not
to
be
thought
of
stapleton
may
fall
in
with
such
a
superstition
and
mortimer
also
but
if
i
have
one
quality
upon
earth
it
is
common
sense
and
nothing
will
persuade
me
to
believe
in
such
a
thing
to
do
so
would
be
to
descend
to
the
level
of
these
poor
peasants
who
are
not
content
with
a
mere
fiend
dog
but
must
needs
describe
him
with
hell
fire
shooting
from
his
mouth
and
eyes
holmes
would
not
listen
to
such
fancies
and
i
am
his
agent
but
facts
are
facts
and
i
have
twice
heard
this
crying
upon
the
moor
suppose
that
there
were
really
some
huge
hound
loose
upon
it
that
would
go
far
to
explain
everything
but
where
could
such
a
hound
lie
concealed
where
did
it
get
its
food
where
did
it
come
from
how
was
it
that
no
one
saw
it
by
day
it
must
be
confessed
that
the
natural
explanation
offers
almost
as
many
difficulties
as
the
other
and
always
apart
from
the
hound
there
is
the
fact
of
the
human
agency
in
london
the
man
in
the
cab
and
the
letter
which
warned
sir
henry
against
the
moor
this
at
least
was
real
but
it
might
have
been
the
work
of
a
protecting
friend
as
easily
as
of
an
enemy
where
is
that
friend
or
enemy
now
has
he
remained
in
london
or
has
he
followed
us
down
here
could
he
could
he
be
the
stranger
whom
i
saw
upon
the
tor
it
is
true
that
i
have
had
only
the
one
glance
at
him
and
yet
there
are
some
things
to
which
i
am
ready
to
swear
he
is
no
one
whom
i
have
seen
down
here
and
i
have
now
met
all
the
neighbours
the
figure
was
far
taller
than
that
of
stapleton
far
thinner
than
that
of
frankland
barrymore
it
might
possibly
have
been
but
we
had
left
him
behind
us
and
i
am
certain
that
he
could
not
have
followed
us
a
stranger
then
is
still
dogging
us
just
as
a
stranger
dogged
us
in
london
we
have
never
shaken
him
off
if
i
could
lay
my
hands
upon
that
man
then
at
last
we
might
find
ourselves
at
the
end
of
all
our
difficulties
to
this
one
purpose
i
must
now
devote
all
my
energies
my
first
impulse
was
to
tell
sir
henry
all
my
plans
my
second
and
wisest
one
is
to
play
my
own
game
and
speak
as
little
as
possible
to
anyone
he
is
silent
and
distrait
his
nerves
have
been
strangely
shaken
by
that
sound
upon
the
moor
i
will
say
nothing
to
add
to
his
anxieties
but
i
will
take
my
own
steps
to
attain
my
own
end
we
had
a
small
scene
this
morning
after
breakfast
barrymore
asked
leave
to
speak
with
sir
henry
and
they
were
closeted
in
his
study
some
little
time
sitting
in
the
billiard
room
i
more
than
once
heard
the
sound
of
voices
raised
and
i
had
a
pretty
good
idea
what
the
point
was
which
was
under
discussion
after
a
time
the
baronet
opened
his
door
and
called
for
me
barrymore
considers
that
he
has
a
grievance
he
said
he
thinks
that
it
was
unfair
on
our
part
to
hunt
his
brother
in
law
down
when
he
of
his
own
free
will
had
told
us
the
secret
the
butler
was
standing
very
pale
but
very
collected
before
us
i
may
have
spoken
too
warmly
sir
said
he
and
if
i
have
i
am
sure
that
i
beg
your
pardon
at
the
same
time
i
was
very
much
surprised
when
i
heard
you
two
gentlemen
come
back
this
morning
and
learned
that
you
had
been
chasing
selden
the
poor
fellow
has
enough
to
fight
against
without
my
putting
more
upon
his
track
if
you
had
told
us
of
your
own
free
will
it
would
have
been
a
different
thing
said
the
baronet
you
only
told
us
or
rather
your
wife
only
told
us
when
it
was
forced
from
you
and
you
could
not
help
yourself
i
didnt
think
you
would
have
taken
advantage
of
it
sir
henry
indeed
i
didnt
the
man
is
a
public
danger
there
are
lonely
houses
scattered
over
the
moor
and
he
is
a
fellow
who
would
stick
at
nothing
you
only
want
to
get
a
glimpse
of
his
face
to
see
that
look
at
mr
stapletons
house
for
example
with
no
one
but
himself
to
defend
it
theres
no
safety
for
anyone
until
he
is
under
lock
and
key
hell
break
into
no
house
sir
i
give
you
my
solemn
word
upon
that
but
he
will
never
trouble
anyone
in
this
country
again
i
assure
you
sir
henry
that
in
a
very
few
days
the
necessary
arrangements
will
have
been
made
and
he
will
be
on
his
way
to
south
america
for
gods
sake
sir
i
beg
of
you
not
to
let
the
police
know
that
he
is
still
on
the
moor
they
have
given
up
the
chase
there
and
he
can
lie
quiet
until
the
ship
is
ready
for
him
you
cant
tell
on
him
without
getting
my
wife
and
me
into
trouble
i
beg
you
sir
to
say
nothing
to
the
police
what
do
you
say
watson
i
shrugged
my
shoulders
if
he
were
safely
out
of
the
country
it
would
relieve
the
tax
payer
of
a
burden
but
how
about
the
chance
of
his
holding
someone
up
before
he
goes
he
would
not
do
anything
so
mad
sir
we
have
provided
him
with
all
that
he
can
want
to
commit
a
crime
would
be
to
show
where
he
was
hiding
that
is
true
said
sir
henry
well
barrymore
god
bless
you
sir
and
thank
you
from
my
heart
it
would
have
killed
my
poor
wife
had
he
been
taken
again
i
guess
we
are
aiding
and
abetting
a
felony
watson
but
after
what
we
have
heard
i
dont
feel
as
if
i
could
give
the
man
up
so
there
is
an
end
of
it
all
right
barrymore
you
can
go
with
a
few
broken
words
of
gratitude
the
man
turned
but
he
hesitated
and
then
came
back
youve
been
so
kind
to
us
sir
that
i
should
like
to
do
the
best
i
can
for
you
in
return
i
know
something
sir
henry
and
perhaps
i
should
have
said
it
before
but
it
was
long
after
the
inquest
that
i
found
it
out
ive
never
breathed
a
word
about
it
yet
to
mortal
man
its
about
poor
sir
charless
death
the
baronet
and
i
were
both
upon
our
feet
do
you
know
how
he
died
no
sir
i
dont
know
that
what
then
i
know
why
he
was
at
the
gate
at
that
hour
it
was
to
meet
a
woman
to
meet
a
woman
he
yes
sir
and
the
womans
name
i
cant
give
you
the
name
sir
but
i
can
give
you
the
initials
her
initials
were
l
l
how
do
you
know
this
barrymore
well
sir
henry
your
uncle
had
a
letter
that
morning
he
had
usually
a
great
many
letters
for
he
was
a
public
man
and
well
known
for
his
kind
heart
so
that
everyone
who
was
in
trouble
was
glad
to
turn
to
him
but
that
morning
as
it
chanced
there
was
only
this
one
letter
so
i
took
the
more
notice
of
it
it
was
from
coombe
tracey
and
it
was
addressed
in
a
womans
hand
well
well
sir
i
thought
no
more
of
the
matter
and
never
would
have
done
had
it
not
been
for
my
wife
only
a
few
weeks
ago
she
was
cleaning
out
sir
charless
study
it
had
never
been
touched
since
his
death
and
she
found
the
ashes
of
a
burned
letter
in
the
back
of
the
grate
the
greater
part
of
it
was
charred
to
pieces
but
one
little
slip
the
end
of
a
page
hung
together
and
the
writing
could
still
be
read
though
it
was
gray
on
a
black
ground
it
seemed
to
us
to
be
a
postscript
at
the
end
of
the
letter
and
it
said
please
please
as
you
are
a
gentleman
burn
this
letter
and
be
at
the
gate
by
ten
o
clock
beneath
it
were
signed
the
initials
l
l
have
you
got
that
slip
no
sir
it
crumbled
all
to
bits
after
we
moved
it
had
sir
charles
received
any
other
letters
in
the
same
writing
well
sir
i
took
no
particular
notice
of
his
letters
i
should
not
have
noticed
this
one
only
it
happened
to
come
alone
and
you
have
no
idea
who
l
l
is
no
sir
no
more
than
you
have
but
i
expect
if
we
could
lay
our
hands
upon
that
lady
we
should
know
more
about
sir
charless
death
i
cannot
understand
barrymore
how
you
came
to
conceal
this
important
information
well
sir
it
was
immediately
after
that
our
own
trouble
came
to
us
and
then
again
sir
we
were
both
of
us
very
fond
of
sir
charles
as
we
well
might
be
considering
all
that
he
has
done
for
us
to
rake
this
up
couldnt
help
our
poor
master
and
its
well
to
go
carefully
when
theres
a
lady
in
the
case
even
the
best
of
us
you
thought
it
might
injure
his
reputation
well
sir
i
thought
no
good
could
come
of
it
but
now
you
have
been
kind
to
us
and
i
feel
as
if
it
would
be
treating
you
unfairly
not
to
tell
you
all
that
i
know
about
the
matter
very
good
barrymore
you
can
go
when
the
butler
had
left
us
sir
henry
turned
to
me
well
watson
what
do
you
think
of
this
new
light
it
seems
to
leave
the
darkness
rather
blacker
than
before
so
i
think
but
if
we
can
only
trace
l
l
it
should
clear
up
the
whole
business
we
have
gained
that
much
we
know
that
there
is
someone
who
has
the
facts
if
we
can
only
find
her
what
do
you
think
we
should
do
let
holmes
know
all
about
it
at
once
it
will
give
him
the
clue
for
which
he
has
been
seeking
i
am
much
mistaken
if
it
does
not
bring
him
down
i
went
at
once
to
my
room
and
drew
up
my
report
of
the
morning
conversation
for
holmes
it
was
evident
to
me
that
he
had
been
very
busy
of
late
for
the
notes
which
i
had
from
baker
street
were
few
and
short
with
no
comments
upon
the
information
which
i
had
supplied
and
hardly
any
reference
to
my
mission
no
doubt
his
blackmailing
case
is
absorbing
all
his
faculties
and
yet
this
new
factor
must
surely
arrest
his
attention
and
renew
his
interest
i
wish
that
he
were
here
october
th
all
day
today
the
rain
poured
down
rustling
on
the
ivy
and
dripping
from
the
eaves
i
thought
of
the
convict
out
upon
the
bleak
cold
shelterless
moor
poor
devil
whatever
his
crimes
he
has
suffered
something
to
atone
for
them
and
then
i
thought
of
that
other
one
the
face
in
the
cab
the
figure
against
the
moon
was
he
also
out
in
that
deluged
the
unseen
watcher
the
man
of
darkness
in
the
evening
i
put
on
my
waterproof
and
i
walked
far
upon
the
sodden
moor
full
of
dark
imaginings
the
rain
beating
upon
my
face
and
the
wind
whistling
about
my
ears
god
help
those
who
wander
into
the
great
mire
now
for
even
the
firm
uplands
are
becoming
a
morass
i
found
the
black
tor
upon
which
i
had
seen
the
solitary
watcher
and
from
its
craggy
summit
i
looked
out
myself
across
the
melancholy
downs
rain
squalls
drifted
across
their
russet
face
and
the
heavy
slate
coloured
clouds
hung
low
over
the
landscape
trailing
in
gray
wreaths
down
the
sides
of
the
fantastic
hills
in
the
distant
hollow
on
the
left
half
hidden
by
the
mist
the
two
thin
towers
of
baskerville
hall
rose
above
the
trees
they
were
the
only
signs
of
human
life
which
i
could
see
save
only
those
prehistoric
huts
which
lay
thickly
upon
the
slopes
of
the
hills
nowhere
was
there
any
trace
of
that
lonely
man
whom
i
had
seen
on
the
same
spot
two
nights
before
as
i
walked
back
i
was
overtaken
by
dr
mortimer
driving
in
his
dog
cart
over
a
rough
moorland
track
which
led
from
the
outlying
farmhouse
of
foulmire
he
has
been
very
attentive
to
us
and
hardly
a
day
has
passed
that
he
has
not
called
at
the
hall
to
see
how
we
were
getting
on
he
insisted
upon
my
climbing
into
his
dog
cart
and
he
gave
me
a
lift
homeward
i
found
him
much
troubled
over
the
disappearance
of
his
little
spaniel
it
had
wandered
on
to
the
moor
and
had
never
come
back
i
gave
him
such
consolation
as
i
might
but
i
thought
of
the
pony
on
the
grimpen
mire
and
i
do
not
fancy
that
he
will
see
his
little
dog
again
by
the
way
mortimer
said
i
as
we
jolted
along
the
rough
road
i
suppose
there
are
few
people
living
within
driving
distance
of
this
whom
you
do
not
know
hardly
any
i
think
can
you
then
tell
me
the
name
of
any
woman
whose
initials
are
l
l
he
thought
for
a
few
minutes
no
said
he
there
are
a
few
gipsies
and
labouring
folk
for
whom
i
cant
answer
but
among
the
farmers
or
gentry
there
is
no
one
whose
initials
are
those
wait
a
bit
though
he
added
after
a
pause
there
is
laura
lyons
her
initials
are
l
l
but
she
lives
in
coombe
tracey
who
is
she
i
asked
she
is
franklands
daughter
what
old
frankland
the
crank
exactly
she
married
an
artist
named
lyons
who
came
sketching
on
the
moor
he
proved
to
be
a
blackguard
and
deserted
her
the
fault
from
what
i
hear
may
not
have
been
entirely
on
one
side
her
father
refused
to
have
anything
to
do
with
her
because
she
had
married
without
his
consent
and
perhaps
for
one
or
two
other
reasons
as
well
so
between
the
old
sinner
and
the
young
one
the
girl
has
had
a
pretty
bad
time
how
does
she
live
i
fancy
old
frankland
allows
her
a
pittance
but
it
cannot
be
more
for
his
own
affairs
are
considerably
involved
whatever
she
may
have
deserved
one
could
not
allow
her
to
go
hopelessly
to
the
bad
her
story
got
about
and
several
of
the
people
here
did
something
to
enable
her
to
earn
an
honest
living
stapleton
did
for
one
and
sir
charles
for
another
i
gave
a
trifle
myself
it
was
to
set
her
up
in
a
typewriting
business
he
wanted
to
know
the
object
of
my
inquiries
but
i
managed
to
satisfy
his
curiosity
without
telling
him
too
much
for
there
is
no
reason
why
we
should
take
anyone
into
our
confidence
tomorrow
morning
i
shall
find
my
way
to
coombe
tracey
and
if
i
can
see
this
mrs
laura
lyons
of
equivocal
reputation
a
long
step
will
have
been
made
towards
clearing
one
incident
in
this
chain
of
mysteries
i
am
certainly
developing
the
wisdom
of
the
serpent
for
when
mortimer
pressed
his
questions
to
an
inconvenient
extent
i
asked
him
casually
to
what
type
franklands
skull
belonged
and
so
heard
nothing
but
craniology
for
the
rest
of
our
drive
i
have
not
lived
for
years
with
sherlock
holmes
for
nothing
i
have
only
one
other
incident
to
record
upon
this
tempestuous
and
melancholy
day
this
was
my
conversation
with
barrymore
just
now
which
gives
me
one
more
strong
card
which
i
can
play
in
due
time
mortimer
had
stayed
to
dinner
and
he
and
the
baronet
played
ecarte
afterwards
the
butler
brought
me
my
coffee
into
the
library
and
i
took
the
chance
to
ask
him
a
few
questions
well
said
i
has
this
precious
relation
of
yours
departed
or
is
he
still
lurking
out
yonder
i
dont
know
sir
i
hope
to
heaven
that
he
has
gone
for
he
has
brought
nothing
but
trouble
here
ive
not
heard
of
him
since
i
left
out
food
for
him
last
and
that
was
three
days
ago
did
you
see
him
then
no
sir
but
the
food
was
gone
when
next
i
went
that
way
then
he
was
certainly
there
so
you
would
think
sir
unless
it
was
the
other
man
who
took
it
i
sat
with
my
coffee
cup
halfway
to
my
lips
and
stared
at
barrymore
you
know
that
there
is
another
man
then
yes
sir
there
is
another
man
upon
the
moor
have
you
seen
him
no
sir
how
do
you
know
of
him
then
selden
told
me
of
him
sir
a
week
ago
or
more
hes
in
hiding
too
but
hes
not
a
convict
as
far
as
i
can
make
out
i
dont
like
it
dr
watson
i
tell
you
straight
sir
that
i
dont
like
it
he
spoke
with
a
sudden
passion
of
earnestness
now
listen
to
me
barrymore
i
have
no
interest
in
this
matter
but
that
of
your
master
i
have
come
here
with
no
object
except
to
help
him
tell
me
frankly
what
it
is
that
you
dont
like
barrymore
hesitated
for
a
moment
as
if
he
regretted
his
outburst
or
found
it
difficult
to
express
his
own
feelings
in
words
its
all
these
goings
on
sir
he
cried
at
last
waving
his
hand
towards
the
rain
lashed
window
which
faced
the
moor
theres
foul
play
somewhere
and
theres
black
villainy
brewing
to
that
ill
swear
very
glad
i
should
be
sir
to
see
sir
henry
on
his
way
back
to
london
again
but
what
is
it
that
alarms
you
look
at
sir
charless
death
that
was
bad
enough
for
all
that
the
coroner
said
look
at
the
noises
on
the
moor
at
night
theres
not
a
man
would
cross
it
after
sundown
if
he
was
paid
for
it
look
at
this
stranger
hiding
out
yonder
and
watching
and
waiting
whats
he
waiting
for
what
does
it
mean
it
means
no
good
to
anyone
of
the
name
of
baskerville
and
very
glad
i
shall
be
to
be
quit
of
it
all
on
the
day
that
sir
henrys
new
servants
are
ready
to
take
over
the
hall
but
about
this
stranger
said
i
can
you
tell
me
anything
about
him
what
did
selden
say
did
he
find
out
where
he
hid
or
what
he
was
doing
he
saw
him
once
or
twice
but
he
is
a
deep
one
and
gives
nothing
away
at
first
he
thought
that
he
was
the
police
but
soon
he
found
that
he
had
some
lay
of
his
own
a
kind
of
gentleman
he
was
as
far
as
he
could
see
but
what
he
was
doing
he
could
not
make
out
and
where
did
he
say
that
he
lived
among
the
old
houses
on
the
hillside
the
stone
huts
where
the
old
folk
used
to
live
but
how
about
his
food
selden
found
out
that
he
has
got
a
lad
who
works
for
him
and
brings
all
he
needs
i
dare
say
he
goes
to
coombe
tracey
for
what
he
wants
very
good
barrymore
we
may
talk
further
of
this
some
other
time
when
the
butler
had
gone
i
walked
over
to
the
black
window
and
i
looked
through
a
blurred
pane
at
the
driving
clouds
and
at
the
tossing
outline
of
the
wind
swept
trees
it
is
a
wild
night
indoors
and
what
must
it
be
in
a
stone
hut
upon
the
moor
what
passion
of
hatred
can
it
be
which
leads
a
man
to
lurk
in
such
a
place
at
such
a
time
and
what
deep
and
earnest
purpose
can
he
have
which
calls
for
such
a
trial
there
in
that
hut
upon
the
moor
seems
to
lie
the
very
centre
of
that
problem
which
has
vexed
me
so
sorely
i
swear
that
another
day
shall
not
have
passed
before
i
have
done
all
that
man
can
do
to
reach
the
heart
of
the
mystery
chapter
the
man
on
the
tor
the
extract
from
my
private
diary
which
forms
the
last
chapter
has
brought
my
narrative
up
to
the
eighteenth
of
october
a
time
when
these
strange
events
began
to
move
swiftly
towards
their
terrible
conclusion
the
incidents
of
the
next
few
days
are
indelibly
graven
upon
my
recollection
and
i
can
tell
them
without
reference
to
the
notes
made
at
the
time
i
start
them
from
the
day
which
succeeded
that
upon
which
i
had
established
two
facts
of
great
importance
the
one
that
mrs
laura
lyons
of
coombe
tracey
had
written
to
sir
charles
baskerville
and
made
an
appointment
with
him
at
the
very
place
and
hour
that
he
met
his
death
the
other
that
the
lurking
man
upon
the
moor
was
to
be
found
among
the
stone
huts
upon
the
hillside
with
these
two
facts
in
my
possession
i
felt
that
either
my
intelligence
or
my
courage
must
be
deficient
if
i
could
not
throw
some
further
light
upon
these
dark
places
i
had
no
opportunity
to
tell
the
baronet
what
i
had
learned
about
mrs
lyons
upon
the
evening
before
for
dr
mortimer
remained
with
him
at
cards
until
it
was
very
late
at
breakfast
however
i
informed
him
about
my
discovery
and
asked
him
whether
he
would
care
to
accompany
me
to
coombe
tracey
at
first
he
was
very
eager
to
come
but
on
second
thoughts
it
seemed
to
both
of
us
that
if
i
went
alone
the
results
might
be
better
the
more
formal
we
made
the
visit
the
less
information
we
might
obtain
i
left
sir
henry
behind
therefore
not
without
some
prickings
of
conscience
and
drove
off
upon
my
new
quest
when
i
reached
coombe
tracey
i
told
perkins
to
put
up
the
horses
and
i
made
inquiries
for
the
lady
whom
i
had
come
to
interrogate
i
had
no
difficulty
in
finding
her
rooms
which
were
central
and
well
appointed
a
maid
showed
me
in
without
ceremony
and
as
i
entered
the
sitting
room
a
lady
who
was
sitting
before
a
remington
typewriter
sprang
up
with
a
pleasant
smile
of
welcome
her
face
fell
however
when
she
saw
that
i
was
a
stranger
and
she
sat
down
again
and
asked
me
the
object
of
my
visit
the
first
impression
left
by
mrs
lyons
was
one
of
extreme
beauty
her
eyes
and
hair
were
of
the
same
rich
hazel
colour
and
her
cheeks
though
considerably
freckled
were
flushed
with
the
exquisite
bloom
of
the
brunette
the
dainty
pink
which
lurks
at
the
heart
of
the
sulphur
rose
admiration
was
i
repeat
the
first
impression
but
the
second
was
criticism
there
was
something
subtly
wrong
with
the
face
some
coarseness
of
expression
some
hardness
perhaps
of
eye
some
looseness
of
lip
which
marred
its
perfect
beauty
but
these
of
course
are
afterthoughts
at
the
moment
i
was
simply
conscious
that
i
was
in
the
presence
of
a
very
handsome
woman
and
that
she
was
asking
me
the
reasons
for
my
visit
i
had
not
quite
understood
until
that
instant
how
delicate
my
mission
was
i
have
the
pleasure
said
i
of
knowing
your
father
it
was
a
clumsy
introduction
and
the
lady
made
me
feel
it
there
is
nothing
in
common
between
my
father
and
me
she
said
i
owe
him
nothing
and
his
friends
are
not
mine
if
it
were
not
for
the
late
sir
charles
baskerville
and
some
other
kind
hearts
i
might
have
starved
for
all
that
my
father
cared
it
was
about
the
late
sir
charles
baskerville
that
i
have
come
here
to
see
you
the
freckles
started
out
on
the
ladys
face
what
can
i
tell
you
about
him
she
asked
and
her
fingers
played
nervously
over
the
stops
of
her
typewriter
you
knew
him
did
you
not
i
have
already
said
that
i
owe
a
great
deal
to
his
kindness
if
i
am
able
to
support
myself
it
is
largely
due
to
the
interest
which
he
took
in
my
unhappy
situation
did
you
correspond
with
him
the
lady
looked
quickly
up
with
an
angry
gleam
in
her
hazel
eyes
what
is
the
object
of
these
questions
she
asked
sharply
the
object
is
to
avoid
a
public
scandal
it
is
better
that
i
should
ask
them
here
than
that
the
matter
should
pass
outside
our
control
she
was
silent
and
her
face
was
still
very
pale
at
last
she
looked
up
with
something
reckless
and
defiant
in
her
manner
well
ill
answer
she
said
what
are
your
questions
did
you
correspond
with
sir
charles
i
certainly
wrote
to
him
once
or
twice
to
acknowledge
his
delicacy
and
his
generosity
have
you
the
dates
of
those
letters
no
have
you
ever
met
him
yes
once
or
twice
when
he
came
into
coombe
tracey
he
was
a
very
retiring
man
and
he
preferred
to
do
good
by
stealth
but
if
you
saw
him
so
seldom
and
wrote
so
seldom
how
did
he
know
enough
about
your
affairs
to
be
able
to
help
you
as
you
say
that
he
has
done
she
met
my
difficulty
with
the
utmost
readiness
there
were
several
gentlemen
who
knew
my
sad
history
and
united
to
help
me
one
was
mr
stapleton
a
neighbour
and
intimate
friend
of
sir
charless
he
was
exceedingly
kind
and
it
was
through
him
that
sir
charles
learned
about
my
affairs
i
knew
already
that
sir
charles
baskerville
had
made
stapleton
his
almoner
upon
several
occasions
so
the
ladys
statement
bore
the
impress
of
truth
upon
it
did
you
ever
write
to
sir
charles
asking
him
to
meet
you
i
continued
mrs
lyons
flushed
with
anger
again
really
sir
this
is
a
very
extraordinary
question
i
am
sorry
madam
but
i
must
repeat
it
then
i
answer
certainly
not
not
on
the
very
day
of
sir
charless
death
the
flush
had
faded
in
an
instant
and
a
deathly
face
was
before
me
her
dry
lips
could
not
speak
the
no
which
i
saw
rather
than
heard
surely
your
memory
deceives
you
said
i
i
could
even
quote
a
passage
of
your
letter
it
ran
please
please
as
you
are
a
gentleman
burn
this
letter
and
be
at
the
gate
by
ten
oclock
i
thought
that
she
had
fainted
but
she
recovered
herself
by
a
supreme
effort
is
there
no
such
thing
as
a
gentleman
she
gasped
you
do
sir
charles
an
injustice
he
did
burn
the
letter
but
sometimes
a
letter
may
be
legible
even
when
burned
you
acknowledge
now
that
you
wrote
it
yes
i
did
write
it
she
cried
pouring
out
her
soul
in
a
torrent
of
words
i
did
write
it
why
should
i
deny
it
i
have
no
reason
to
be
ashamed
of
it
i
wished
him
to
help
me
i
believed
that
if
i
had
an
interview
i
could
gain
his
help
so
i
asked
him
to
meet
me
but
why
at
such
an
hour
because
i
had
only
just
learned
that
he
was
going
to
london
next
day
and
might
be
away
for
months
there
were
reasons
why
i
could
not
get
there
earlier
but
why
a
rendezvous
in
the
garden
instead
of
a
visit
to
the
house
do
you
think
a
woman
could
go
alone
at
that
hour
to
a
bachelor
house
well
what
happened
when
you
did
get
there
i
never
went
mrs
lyons
no
i
swear
it
to
you
on
all
i
hold
sacred
i
never
went
something
intervened
to
prevent
my
going
what
was
that
that
is
a
private
matter
i
cannot
tell
it
you
acknowledge
then
that
you
made
an
appointment
with
sir
charles
at
the
very
hour
and
place
at
which
he
met
his
death
but
you
deny
that
you
kept
the
appointment
that
is
the
truth
again
and
again
i
cross
questioned
her
but
i
could
never
get
past
that
point
mrs
lyons
said
i
as
i
rose
from
this
long
and
inconclusive
interview
you
are
taking
a
very
great
responsibility
and
putting
yourself
in
a
very
false
position
by
not
making
an
absolutely
clean
breast
of
all
that
you
know
if
i
have
to
call
in
the
aid
of
the
police
you
will
find
how
seriously
you
are
compromised
if
your
position
is
innocent
why
did
you
in
the
first
instance
deny
having
written
to
sir
charles
upon
that
date
because
i
feared
that
some
false
conclusion
might
be
drawn
from
it
and
that
i
might
find
myself
involved
in
a
scandal
and
why
were
you
so
pressing
that
sir
charles
should
destroy
your
letter
if
you
have
read
the
letter
you
will
know
i
did
not
say
that
i
had
read
all
the
letter
you
quoted
some
of
it
i
quoted
the
postscript
the
letter
had
as
i
said
been
burned
and
it
was
not
all
legible
i
ask
you
once
again
why
it
was
that
you
were
so
pressing
that
sir
charles
should
destroy
this
letter
which
he
received
on
the
day
of
his
death
the
matter
is
a
very
private
one
the
more
reason
why
you
should
avoid
a
public
investigation
i
will
tell
you
then
if
you
have
heard
anything
of
my
unhappy
history
you
will
know
that
i
made
a
rash
marriage
and
had
reason
to
regret
it
i
have
heard
so
much
my
life
has
been
one
incessant
persecution
from
a
husband
whom
i
abhor
the
law
is
upon
his
side
and
every
day
i
am
faced
by
the
possibility
that
he
may
force
me
to
live
with
him
at
the
time
that
i
wrote
this
letter
to
sir
charles
i
had
learned
that
there
was
a
prospect
of
my
regaining
my
freedom
if
certain
expenses
could
be
met
it
meant
everything
to
me
peace
of
mind
happiness
self
respect
everything
i
knew
sir
charless
generosity
and
i
thought
that
if
he
heard
the
story
from
my
own
lips
he
would
help
me
then
how
is
it
that
you
did
not
go
because
i
received
help
in
the
interval
from
another
source
why
then
did
you
not
write
to
sir
charles
and
explain
this
so
i
should
have
done
had
i
not
seen
his
death
in
the
paper
next
morning
the
womans
story
hung
coherently
together
and
all
my
questions
were
unable
to
shake
it
i
could
only
check
it
by
finding
if
she
had
indeed
instituted
divorce
proceedings
against
her
husband
at
or
about
the
time
of
the
tragedy
it
was
unlikely
that
she
would
dare
to
say
that
she
had
not
been
to
baskerville
hall
if
she
really
had
been
for
a
trap
would
be
necessary
to
take
her
there
and
could
not
have
returned
to
coombe
tracey
until
the
early
hours
of
the
morning
such
an
excursion
could
not
be
kept
secret
the
probability
was
therefore
that
she
was
telling
the
truth
or
at
least
a
part
of
the
truth
i
came
away
baffled
and
disheartened
once
again
i
had
reached
that
dead
wall
which
seemed
to
be
built
across
every
path
by
which
i
tried
to
get
at
the
object
of
my
mission
and
yet
the
more
i
thought
of
the
ladys
face
and
of
her
manner
the
more
i
felt
that
something
was
being
held
back
from
me
why
should
she
turn
so
pale
why
should
she
fight
against
every
admission
until
it
was
forced
from
her
why
should
she
have
been
so
reticent
at
the
time
of
the
tragedy
surely
the
explanation
of
all
this
could
not
be
as
innocent
as
she
would
have
me
believe
for
the
moment
i
could
proceed
no
farther
in
that
direction
but
must
turn
back
to
that
other
clue
which
was
to
be
sought
for
among
the
stone
huts
upon
the
moor
and
that
was
a
most
vague
direction
i
realized
it
as
i
drove
back
and
noted
how
hill
after
hill
showed
traces
of
the
ancient
people
barrymores
only
indication
had
been
that
the
stranger
lived
in
one
of
these
abandoned
huts
and
many
hundreds
of
them
are
scattered
throughout
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
moor
but
i
had
my
own
experience
for
a
guide
since
it
had
shown
me
the
man
himself
standing
upon
the
summit
of
the
black
tor
that
then
should
be
the
centre
of
my
search
from
there
i
should
explore
every
hut
upon
the
moor
until
i
lighted
upon
the
right
one
if
this
man
were
inside
it
i
should
find
out
from
his
own
lips
at
the
point
of
my
revolver
if
necessary
who
he
was
and
why
he
had
dogged
us
so
long
he
might
slip
away
from
us
in
the
crowd
of
regent
street
but
it
would
puzzle
him
to
do
so
upon
the
lonely
moor
on
the
other
hand
if
i
should
find
the
hut
and
its
tenant
should
not
be
within
it
i
must
remain
there
however
long
the
vigil
until
he
returned
holmes
had
missed
him
in
london
it
would
indeed
be
a
triumph
for
me
if
i
could
run
him
to
earth
where
my
master
had
failed
luck
had
been
against
us
again
and
again
in
this
inquiry
but
now
at
last
it
came
to
my
aid
and
the
messenger
of
good
fortune
was
none
other
than
mr
frankland
who
was
standing
gray
whiskered
and
red
faced
outside
the
gate
of
his
garden
which
opened
on
to
the
highroad
along
which
i
travelled
good
day
dr
watson
cried
he
with
unwonted
good
humour
you
must
really
give
your
horses
a
rest
and
come
in
to
have
a
glass
of
wine
and
to
congratulate
me
my
feelings
towards
him
were
very
far
from
being
friendly
after
what
i
had
heard
of
his
treatment
of
his
daughter
but
i
was
anxious
to
send
perkins
and
the
wagonette
home
and
the
opportunity
was
a
good
one
i
alighted
and
sent
a
message
to
sir
henry
that
i
should
walk
over
in
time
for
dinner
then
i
followed
frankland
into
his
dining
room
it
is
a
great
day
for
me
sir
one
of
the
red
letter
days
of
my
life
he
cried
with
many
chuckles
i
have
brought
off
a
double
event
i
mean
to
teach
them
in
these
parts
that
law
is
law
and
that
there
is
a
man
here
who
does
not
fear
to
invoke
it
i
have
established
a
right
of
way
through
the
centre
of
old
middletons
park
slap
across
it
sir
within
a
hundred
yards
of
his
own
front
door
what
do
you
think
of
that
well
teach
these
magnates
that
they
cannot
ride
roughshod
over
the
rights
of
the
commoners
confound
them
and
ive
closed
the
wood
where
the
fernworthy
folk
used
to
picnic
these
infernal
people
seem
to
think
that
there
are
no
rights
of
property
and
that
they
can
swarm
where
they
like
with
their
papers
and
their
bottles
both
cases
decided
dr
watson
and
both
in
my
favour
i
havent
had
such
a
day
since
i
had
sir
john
morland
for
trespass
because
he
shot
in
his
own
warren
how
on
earth
did
you
do
that
look
it
up
in
the
books
sir
it
will
repay
reading
frankland
v
morland
court
of
queens
bench
it
cost
me
pounds
but
i
got
my
verdict
did
it
do
you
any
good
none
sir
none
i
am
proud
to
say
that
i
had
no
interest
in
the
matter
i
act
entirely
from
a
sense
of
public
duty
i
have
no
doubt
for
example
that
the
fernworthy
people
will
burn
me
in
effigy
tonight
i
told
the
police
last
time
they
did
it
that
they
should
stop
these
disgraceful
exhibitions
the
county
constabulary
is
in
a
scandalous
state
sir
and
it
has
not
afforded
me
the
protection
to
which
i
am
entitled
the
case
of
frankland
v
regina
will
bring
the
matter
before
the
attention
of
the
public
i
told
them
that
they
would
have
occasion
to
regret
their
treatment
of
me
and
already
my
words
have
come
true
how
so
i
asked
the
old
man
put
on
a
very
knowing
expression
because
i
could
tell
them
what
they
are
dying
to
know
but
nothing
would
induce
me
to
help
the
rascals
in
any
way
i
had
been
casting
round
for
some
excuse
by
which
i
could
get
away
from
his
gossip
but
now
i
began
to
wish
to
hear
more
of
it
i
had
seen
enough
of
the
contrary
nature
of
the
old
sinner
to
understand
that
any
strong
sign
of
interest
would
be
the
surest
way
to
stop
his
confidences
some
poaching
case
no
doubt
said
i
with
an
indifferent
manner
ha
ha
my
boy
a
very
much
more
important
matter
than
that
what
about
the
convict
on
the
moor
i
stared
you
dont
mean
that
you
know
where
he
is
said
i
i
may
not
know
exactly
where
he
is
but
i
am
quite
sure
that
i
could
help
the
police
to
lay
their
hands
on
him
has
it
never
struck
you
that
the
way
to
catch
that
man
was
to
find
out
where
he
got
his
food
and
so
trace
it
to
him
he
certainly
seemed
to
be
getting
uncomfortably
near
the
truth
no
doubt
said
i
but
how
do
you
know
that
he
is
anywhere
upon
the
moor
i
know
it
because
i
have
seen
with
my
own
eyes
the
messenger
who
takes
him
his
food
my
heart
sank
for
barrymore
it
was
a
serious
thing
to
be
in
the
power
of
this
spiteful
old
busybody
but
his
next
remark
took
a
weight
from
my
mind
youll
be
surprised
to
hear
that
his
food
is
taken
to
him
by
a
child
i
see
him
every
day
through
my
telescope
upon
the
roof
he
passes
along
the
same
path
at
the
same
hour
and
to
whom
should
he
be
going
except
to
the
convict
here
was
luck
indeed
and
yet
i
suppressed
all
appearance
of
interest
a
child
barrymore
had
said
that
our
unknown
was
supplied
by
a
boy
it
was
on
his
track
and
not
upon
the
convicts
that
frankland
had
stumbled
if
i
could
get
his
knowledge
it
might
save
me
a
long
and
weary
hunt
but
incredulity
and
indifference
were
evidently
my
strongest
cards
i
should
say
that
it
was
much
more
likely
that
it
was
the
son
of
one
of
the
moorland
shepherds
taking
out
his
fathers
dinner
the
least
appearance
of
opposition
struck
fire
out
of
the
old
autocrat
his
eyes
looked
malignantly
at
me
and
his
gray
whiskers
bristled
like
those
of
an
angry
cat
indeed
sir
said
he
pointing
out
over
the
wide
stretching
moor
do
you
see
that
black
tor
over
yonder
well
do
you
see
the
low
hill
beyond
with
the
thornbush
upon
it
it
is
the
stoniest
part
of
the
whole
moor
is
that
a
place
where
a
shepherd
would
be
likely
to
take
his
station
your
suggestion
sir
is
a
most
absurd
one
i
meekly
answered
that
i
had
spoken
without
knowing
all
the
facts
my
submission
pleased
him
and
led
him
to
further
confidences
you
may
be
sure
sir
that
i
have
very
good
grounds
before
i
come
to
an
opinion
i
have
seen
the
boy
again
and
again
with
his
bundle
every
day
and
sometimes
twice
a
day
i
have
been
able
but
wait
a
moment
dr
watson
do
my
eyes
deceive
me
or
is
there
at
the
present
moment
something
moving
upon
that
hillside
it
was
several
miles
off
but
i
could
distinctly
see
a
small
dark
dot
against
the
dull
green
and
gray
come
sir
come
cried
frankland
rushing
upstairs
you
will
see
with
your
own
eyes
and
judge
for
yourself
the
telescope
a
formidable
instrument
mounted
upon
a
tripod
stood
upon
the
flat
leads
of
the
house
frankland
clapped
his
eye
to
it
and
gave
a
cry
of
satisfaction
quick
dr
watson
quick
before
he
passes
over
the
hill
there
he
was
sure
enough
a
small
urchin
with
a
little
bundle
upon
his
shoulder
toiling
slowly
up
the
hill
when
he
reached
the
crest
i
saw
the
ragged
uncouth
figure
outlined
for
an
instant
against
the
cold
blue
sky
he
looked
round
him
with
a
furtive
and
stealthy
air
as
one
who
dreads
pursuit
then
he
vanished
over
the
hill
well
am
i
right
certainly
there
is
a
boy
who
seems
to
have
some
secret
errand
and
what
the
errand
is
even
a
county
constable
could
guess
but
not
one
word
shall
they
have
from
me
and
i
bind
you
to
secrecy
also
dr
watson
not
a
word
you
understand
just
as
you
wish
they
have
treated
me
shamefully
shamefully
when
the
facts
come
out
in
frankland
v
regina
i
venture
to
think
that
a
thrill
of
indignation
will
run
through
the
country
nothing
would
induce
me
to
help
the
police
in
any
way
for
all
they
cared
it
might
have
been
me
instead
of
my
effigy
which
these
rascals
burned
at
the
stake
surely
you
are
not
going
you
will
help
me
to
empty
the
decanter
in
honour
of
this
great
occasion
but
i
resisted
all
his
solicitations
and
succeeded
in
dissuading
him
from
his
announced
intention
of
walking
home
with
me
i
kept
the
road
as
long
as
his
eye
was
on
me
and
then
i
struck
off
across
the
moor
and
made
for
the
stony
hill
over
which
the
boy
had
disappeared
everything
was
working
in
my
favour
and
i
swore
that
it
should
not
be
through
lack
of
energy
or
perseverance
that
i
should
miss
the
chance
which
fortune
had
thrown
in
my
way
the
sun
was
already
sinking
when
i
reached
the
summit
of
the
hill
and
the
long
slopes
beneath
me
were
all
golden
green
on
one
side
and
gray
shadow
on
the
other
a
haze
lay
low
upon
the
farthest
sky
line
out
of
which
jutted
the
fantastic
shapes
of
belliver
and
vixen
tor
over
the
wide
expanse
there
was
no
sound
and
no
movement
one
great
gray
bird
a
gull
or
curlew
soared
aloft
in
the
blue
heaven
he
and
i
seemed
to
be
the
only
living
things
between
the
huge
arch
of
the
sky
and
the
desert
beneath
it
the
barren
scene
the
sense
of
loneliness
and
the
mystery
and
urgency
of
my
task
all
struck
a
chill
into
my
heart
the
boy
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
but
down
beneath
me
in
a
cleft
of
the
hills
there
was
a
circle
of
the
old
stone
huts
and
in
the
middle
of
them
there
was
one
which
retained
sufficient
roof
to
act
as
a
screen
against
the
weather
my
heart
leaped
within
me
as
i
saw
it
this
must
be
the
burrow
where
the
stranger
lurked
at
last
my
foot
was
on
the
threshold
of
his
hiding
place
his
secret
was
within
my
grasp
as
i
approached
the
hut
walking
as
warily
as
stapleton
would
do
when
with
poised
net
he
drew
near
the
settled
butterfly
i
satisfied
myself
that
the
place
had
indeed
been
used
as
a
habitation
a
vague
pathway
among
the
boulders
led
to
the
dilapidated
opening
which
served
as
a
door
all
was
silent
within
the
unknown
might
be
lurking
there
or
he
might
be
prowling
on
the
moor
my
nerves
tingled
with
the
sense
of
adventure
throwing
aside
my
cigarette
i
closed
my
hand
upon
the
butt
of
my
revolver
and
walking
swiftly
up
to
the
door
i
looked
in
the
place
was
empty
but
there
were
ample
signs
that
i
had
not
come
upon
a
false
scent
this
was
certainly
where
the
man
lived
some
blankets
rolled
in
a
waterproof
lay
upon
that
very
stone
slab
upon
which
neolithic
man
had
once
slumbered
the
ashes
of
a
fire
were
heaped
in
a
rude
grate
beside
it
lay
some
cooking
utensils
and
a
bucket
half
full
of
water
a
litter
of
empty
tins
showed
that
the
place
had
been
occupied
for
some
time
and
i
saw
as
my
eyes
became
accustomed
to
the
checkered
light
a
pannikin
and
a
half
full
bottle
of
spirits
standing
in
the
corner
in
the
middle
of
the
hut
a
flat
stone
served
the
purpose
of
a
table
and
upon
this
stood
a
small
cloth
bundle
the
same
no
doubt
which
i
had
seen
through
the
telescope
upon
the
shoulder
of
the
boy
it
contained
a
loaf
of
bread
a
tinned
tongue
and
two
tins
of
preserved
peaches
as
i
set
it
down
again
after
having
examined
it
my
heart
leaped
to
see
that
beneath
it
there
lay
a
sheet
of
paper
with
writing
upon
it
i
raised
it
and
this
was
what
i
read
roughly
scrawled
in
pencil
dr
watson
has
gone
to
coombe
tracey
for
a
minute
i
stood
there
with
the
paper
in
my
hands
thinking
out
the
meaning
of
this
curt
message
it
was
i
then
and
not
sir
henry
who
was
being
dogged
by
this
secret
man
he
had
not
followed
me
himself
but
he
had
set
an
agent
the
boy
perhaps
upon
my
track
and
this
was
his
report
possibly
i
had
taken
no
step
since
i
had
been
upon
the
moor
which
had
not
been
observed
and
reported
always
there
was
this
feeling
of
an
unseen
force
a
fine
net
drawn
round
us
with
infinite
skill
and
delicacy
holding
us
so
lightly
that
it
was
only
at
some
supreme
moment
that
one
realized
that
one
was
indeed
entangled
in
its
meshes
if
there
was
one
report
there
might
be
others
so
i
looked
round
the
hut
in
search
of
them
there
was
no
trace
however
of
anything
of
the
kind
nor
could
i
discover
any
sign
which
might
indicate
the
character
or
intentions
of
the
man
who
lived
in
this
singular
place
save
that
he
must
be
of
spartan
habits
and
cared
little
for
the
comforts
of
life
when
i
thought
of
the
heavy
rains
and
looked
at
the
gaping
roof
i
understood
how
strong
and
immutable
must
be
the
purpose
which
had
kept
him
in
that
inhospitable
abode
was
he
our
malignant
enemy
or
was
he
by
chance
our
guardian
angel
i
swore
that
i
would
not
leave
the
hut
until
i
knew
outside
the
sun
was
sinking
low
and
the
west
was
blazing
with
scarlet
and
gold
its
reflection
was
shot
back
in
ruddy
patches
by
the
distant
pools
which
lay
amid
the
great
grimpen
mire
there
were
the
two
towers
of
baskerville
hall
and
there
a
distant
blur
of
smoke
which
marked
the
village
of
grimpen
between
the
two
behind
the
hill
was
the
house
of
the
stapletons
all
was
sweet
and
mellow
and
peaceful
in
the
golden
evening
light
and
yet
as
i
looked
at
them
my
soul
shared
none
of
the
peace
of
nature
but
quivered
at
the
vagueness
and
the
terror
of
that
interview
which
every
instant
was
bringing
nearer
with
tingling
nerves
but
a
fixed
purpose
i
sat
in
the
dark
recess
of
the
hut
and
waited
with
sombre
patience
for
the
coming
of
its
tenant
and
then
at
last
i
heard
him
far
away
came
the
sharp
clink
of
a
boot
striking
upon
a
stone
then
another
and
yet
another
coming
nearer
and
nearer
i
shrank
back
into
the
darkest
corner
and
cocked
the
pistol
in
my
pocket
determined
not
to
discover
myself
until
i
had
an
opportunity
of
seeing
something
of
the
stranger
there
was
a
long
pause
which
showed
that
he
had
stopped
then
once
more
the
footsteps
approached
and
a
shadow
fell
across
the
opening
of
the
hut
it
is
a
lovely
evening
my
dear
watson
said
a
well
known
voice
i
really
think
that
you
will
be
more
comfortable
outside
than
in
chapter
death
on
the
moor
for
a
moment
or
two
i
sat
breathless
hardly
able
to
believe
my
ears
then
my
senses
and
my
voice
came
back
to
me
while
a
crushing
weight
of
responsibility
seemed
in
an
instant
to
be
lifted
from
my
soul
that
cold
incisive
ironical
voice
could
belong
to
but
one
man
in
all
the
world
holmes
i
cried
holmes
come
out
said
he
and
please
be
careful
with
the
revolver
i
stooped
under
the
rude
lintel
and
there
he
sat
upon
a
stone
outside
his
gray
eyes
dancing
with
amusement
as
they
fell
upon
my
astonished
features
he
was
thin
and
worn
but
clear
and
alert
his
keen
face
bronzed
by
the
sun
and
roughened
by
the
wind
in
his
tweed
suit
and
cloth
cap
he
looked
like
any
other
tourist
upon
the
moor
and
he
had
contrived
with
that
catlike
love
of
personal
cleanliness
which
was
one
of
his
characteristics
that
his
chin
should
be
as
smooth
and
his
linen
as
perfect
as
if
he
were
in
baker
street
i
never
was
more
glad
to
see
anyone
in
my
life
said
i
as
i
wrung
him
by
the
hand
or
more
astonished
eh
well
i
must
confess
to
it
the
surprise
was
not
all
on
one
side
i
assure
you
i
had
no
idea
that
you
had
found
my
occasional
retreat
still
less
that
you
were
inside
it
until
i
was
within
twenty
paces
of
the
door
my
footprint
i
presume
no
watson
i
fear
that
i
could
not
undertake
to
recognize
your
footprint
amid
all
the
footprints
of
the
world
if
you
seriously
desire
to
deceive
me
you
must
change
your
tobacconist
for
when
i
see
the
stub
of
a
cigarette
marked
bradley
oxford
street
i
know
that
my
friend
watson
is
in
the
neighbourhood
you
will
see
it
there
beside
the
path
you
threw
it
down
no
doubt
at
that
supreme
moment
when
you
charged
into
the
empty
hut
exactly
i
thought
as
much
and
knowing
your
admirable
tenacity
i
was
convinced
that
you
were
sitting
in
ambush
a
weapon
within
reach
waiting
for
the
tenant
to
return
so
you
actually
thought
that
i
was
the
criminal
i
did
not
know
who
you
were
but
i
was
determined
to
find
out
excellent
watson
and
how
did
you
localize
me
you
saw
me
perhaps
on
the
night
of
the
convict
hunt
when
i
was
so
imprudent
as
to
allow
the
moon
to
rise
behind
me
yes
i
saw
you
then
and
have
no
doubt
searched
all
the
huts
until
you
came
to
this
one
no
your
boy
had
been
observed
and
that
gave
me
a
guide
where
to
look
the
old
gentleman
with
the
telescope
no
doubt
i
could
not
make
it
out
when
first
i
saw
the
light
flashing
upon
the
lens
he
rose
and
peeped
into
the
hut
ha
i
see
that
cartwright
has
brought
up
some
supplies
whats
this
paper
so
you
have
been
to
coombe
tracey
have
you
yes
to
see
mrs
laura
lyons
exactly
well
done
our
researches
have
evidently
been
running
on
parallel
lines
and
when
we
unite
our
results
i
expect
we
shall
have
a
fairly
full
knowledge
of
the
case
well
i
am
glad
from
my
heart
that
you
are
here
for
indeed
the
responsibility
and
the
mystery
were
both
becoming
too
much
for
my
nerves
but
how
in
the
name
of
wonder
did
you
come
here
and
what
have
you
been
doing
i
thought
that
you
were
in
baker
street
working
out
that
case
of
blackmailing
that
was
what
i
wished
you
to
think
then
you
use
me
and
yet
do
not
trust
me
i
cried
with
some
bitterness
i
think
that
i
have
deserved
better
at
your
hands
holmes
my
dear
fellow
you
have
been
invaluable
to
me
in
this
as
in
many
other
cases
and
i
beg
that
you
will
forgive
me
if
i
have
seemed
to
play
a
trick
upon
you
in
truth
it
was
partly
for
your
own
sake
that
i
did
it
and
it
was
my
appreciation
of
the
danger
which
you
ran
which
led
me
to
come
down
and
examine
the
matter
for
myself
had
i
been
with
sir
henry
and
you
it
is
confident
that
my
point
of
view
would
have
been
the
same
as
yours
and
my
presence
would
have
warned
our
very
formidable
opponents
to
be
on
their
guard
as
it
is
i
have
been
able
to
get
about
as
i
could
not
possibly
have
done
had
i
been
living
in
the
hall
and
i
remain
an
unknown
factor
in
the
business
ready
to
throw
in
all
my
weight
at
a
critical
moment
but
why
keep
me
in
the
dark
for
you
to
know
could
not
have
helped
us
and
might
possibly
have
led
to
my
discovery
you
would
have
wished
to
tell
me
something
or
in
your
kindness
you
would
have
brought
me
out
some
comfort
or
other
and
so
an
unnecessary
risk
would
be
run
i
brought
cartwright
down
with
me
you
remember
the
little
chap
at
the
express
office
and
he
has
seen
after
my
simple
wants
a
loaf
of
bread
and
a
clean
collar
what
does
man
want
more
he
has
given
me
an
extra
pair
of
eyes
upon
a
very
active
pair
of
feet
and
both
have
been
invaluable
then
my
reports
have
all
been
wasted
my
voice
trembled
as
i
recalled
the
pains
and
the
pride
with
which
i
had
composed
them
holmes
took
a
bundle
of
papers
from
his
pocket
here
are
your
reports
my
dear
fellow
and
very
well
thumbed
i
assure
you
i
made
excellent
arrangements
and
they
are
only
delayed
one
day
upon
their
way
i
must
compliment
you
exceedingly
upon
the
zeal
and
the
intelligence
which
you
have
shown
over
an
extraordinarily
difficult
case
i
was
still
rather
raw
over
the
deception
which
had
been
practised
upon
me
but
the
warmth
of
holmess
praise
drove
my
anger
from
my
mind
i
felt
also
in
my
heart
that
he
was
right
in
what
he
said
and
that
it
was
really
best
for
our
purpose
that
i
should
not
have
known
that
he
was
upon
the
moor
thats
better
said
he
seeing
the
shadow
rise
from
my
face
and
now
tell
me
the
result
of
your
visit
to
mrs
laura
lyons
it
was
not
difficult
for
me
to
guess
that
it
was
to
see
her
that
you
had
gone
for
i
am
already
aware
that
she
is
the
one
person
in
coombe
tracey
who
might
be
of
service
to
us
in
the
matter
in
fact
if
you
had
not
gone
today
it
is
exceedingly
probable
that
i
should
have
gone
tomorrow
the
sun
had
set
and
dusk
was
settling
over
the
moor
the
air
had
turned
chill
and
we
withdrew
into
the
hut
for
warmth
there
sitting
together
in
the
twilight
i
told
holmes
of
my
conversation
with
the
lady
so
interested
was
he
that
i
had
to
repeat
some
of
it
twice
before
he
was
satisfied
this
is
most
important
said
he
when
i
had
concluded
it
fills
up
a
gap
which
i
had
been
unable
to
bridge
in
this
most
complex
affair
you
are
aware
perhaps
that
a
close
intimacy
exists
between
this
lady
and
the
man
stapleton
i
did
not
know
of
a
close
intimacy
there
can
be
no
doubt
about
the
matter
they
meet
they
write
there
is
a
complete
understanding
between
them
now
this
puts
a
very
powerful
weapon
into
our
hands
if
i
could
only
use
it
to
detach
his
wife
his
wife
i
am
giving
you
some
information
now
in
return
for
all
that
you
have
given
me
the
lady
who
has
passed
here
as
miss
stapleton
is
in
reality
his
wife
good
heavens
holmes
are
you
sure
of
what
you
say
how
could
he
have
permitted
sir
henry
to
fall
in
love
with
her
sir
henrys
falling
in
love
could
do
no
harm
to
anyone
except
sir
henry
he
took
particular
care
that
sir
henry
did
not
make
love
to
her
as
you
have
yourself
observed
i
repeat
that
the
lady
is
his
wife
and
not
his
sister
but
why
this
elaborate
deception
because
he
foresaw
that
she
would
be
very
much
more
useful
to
him
in
the
character
of
a
free
woman
all
my
unspoken
instincts
my
vague
suspicions
suddenly
took
shape
and
centred
upon
the
naturalist
in
that
impassive
colourless
man
with
his
straw
hat
and
his
butterfly
net
i
seemed
to
see
something
terrible
a
creature
of
infinite
patience
and
craft
with
a
smiling
face
and
a
murderous
heart
it
is
he
then
who
is
our
enemy
it
is
he
who
dogged
us
in
london
so
i
read
the
riddle
and
the
warning
it
must
have
come
from
her
exactly
the
shape
of
some
monstrous
villainy
half
seen
half
guessed
loomed
through
the
darkness
which
had
girt
me
so
long
but
are
you
sure
of
this
holmes
how
do
you
know
that
the
woman
is
his
wife
because
he
so
far
forgot
himself
as
to
tell
you
a
true
piece
of
autobiography
upon
the
occasion
when
he
first
met
you
and
i
dare
say
he
has
many
a
time
regretted
it
since
he
was
once
a
schoolmaster
in
the
north
of
england
now
there
is
no
one
more
easy
to
trace
than
a
schoolmaster
there
are
scholastic
agencies
by
which
one
may
identify
any
man
who
has
been
in
the
profession
a
little
investigation
showed
me
that
a
school
had
come
to
grief
under
atrocious
circumstances
and
that
the
man
who
had
owned
it
the
name
was
different
had
disappeared
with
his
wife
the
descriptions
agreed
when
i
learned
that
the
missing
man
was
devoted
to
entomology
the
identification
was
complete
the
darkness
was
rising
but
much
was
still
hidden
by
the
shadows
if
this
woman
is
in
truth
his
wife
where
does
mrs
laura
lyons
come
in
i
asked
that
is
one
of
the
points
upon
which
your
own
researches
have
shed
a
light
your
interview
with
the
lady
has
cleared
the
situation
very
much
i
did
not
know
about
a
projected
divorce
between
herself
and
her
husband
in
that
case
regarding
stapleton
as
an
unmarried
man
she
counted
no
doubt
upon
becoming
his
wife
and
when
she
is
undeceived
why
then
we
may
find
the
lady
of
service
it
must
be
our
first
duty
to
see
her
both
of
us
tomorrow
dont
you
think
watson
that
you
are
away
from
your
charge
rather
long
your
place
should
be
at
baskerville
hall
the
last
red
streaks
had
faded
away
in
the
west
and
night
had
settled
upon
the
moor
a
few
faint
stars
were
gleaming
in
a
violet
sky
one
last
question
holmes
i
said
as
i
rose
surely
there
is
no
need
of
secrecy
between
you
and
me
what
is
the
meaning
of
it
all
what
is
he
after
holmess
voice
sank
as
he
answered
it
is
murder
watson
refined
cold
blooded
deliberate
murder
do
not
ask
me
for
particulars
my
nets
are
closing
upon
him
even
as
his
are
upon
sir
henry
and
with
your
help
he
is
already
almost
at
my
mercy
there
is
but
one
danger
which
can
threaten
us
it
is
that
he
should
strike
before
we
are
ready
to
do
so
another
day
two
at
the
most
and
i
have
my
case
complete
but
until
then
guard
your
charge
as
closely
as
ever
a
fond
mother
watched
her
ailing
child
your
mission
today
has
justified
itself
and
yet
i
could
almost
wish
that
you
had
not
left
his
side
hark
a
terrible
scream
a
prolonged
yell
of
horror
and
anguish
burst
out
of
the
silence
of
the
moor
that
frightful
cry
turned
the
blood
to
ice
in
my
veins
oh
my
god
i
gasped
what
is
it
what
does
it
mean
holmes
had
sprung
to
his
feet
and
i
saw
his
dark
athletic
outline
at
the
door
of
the
hut
his
shoulders
stooping
his
head
thrust
forward
his
face
peering
into
the
darkness
hush
he
whispered
hush
the
cry
had
been
loud
on
account
of
its
vehemence
but
it
had
pealed
out
from
somewhere
far
off
on
the
shadowy
plain
now
it
burst
upon
our
ears
nearer
louder
more
urgent
than
before
where
is
it
holmes
whispered
and
i
knew
from
the
thrill
of
his
voice
that
he
the
man
of
iron
was
shaken
to
the
soul
where
is
it
watson
there
i
think
i
pointed
into
the
darkness
no
there
again
the
agonized
cry
swept
through
the
silent
night
louder
and
much
nearer
than
ever
and
a
new
sound
mingled
with
it
a
deep
muttered
rumble
musical
and
yet
menacing
rising
and
falling
like
the
low
constant
murmur
of
the
sea
the
hound
cried
holmes
come
watson
come
great
heavens
if
we
are
too
late
he
had
started
running
swiftly
over
the
moor
and
i
had
followed
at
his
heels
but
now
from
somewhere
among
the
broken
ground
immediately
in
front
of
us
there
came
one
last
despairing
yell
and
then
a
dull
heavy
thud
we
halted
and
listened
not
another
sound
broke
the
heavy
silence
of
the
windless
night
i
saw
holmes
put
his
hand
to
his
forehead
like
a
man
distracted
he
stamped
his
feet
upon
the
ground
he
has
beaten
us
watson
we
are
too
late
no
no
surely
not
fool
that
i
was
to
hold
my
hand
and
you
watson
see
what
comes
of
abandoning
your
charge
but
by
heaven
if
the
worst
has
happened
well
avenge
him
blindly
we
ran
through
the
gloom
blundering
against
boulders
forcing
our
way
through
gorse
bushes
panting
up
hills
and
rushing
down
slopes
heading
always
in
the
direction
whence
those
dreadful
sounds
had
come
at
every
rise
holmes
looked
eagerly
round
him
but
the
shadows
were
thick
upon
the
moor
and
nothing
moved
upon
its
dreary
face
can
you
see
anything
nothing
but
hark
what
is
that
a
low
moan
had
fallen
upon
our
ears
there
it
was
again
upon
our
left
on
that
side
a
ridge
of
rocks
ended
in
a
sheer
cliff
which
overlooked
a
stone
strewn
slope
on
its
jagged
face
was
spread
eagled
some
dark
irregular
object
as
we
ran
towards
it
the
vague
outline
hardened
into
a
definite
shape
it
was
a
prostrate
man
face
downward
upon
the
ground
the
head
doubled
under
him
at
a
horrible
angle
the
shoulders
rounded
and
the
body
hunched
together
as
if
in
the
act
of
throwing
a
somersault
so
grotesque
was
the
attitude
that
i
could
not
for
the
instant
realize
that
that
moan
had
been
the
passing
of
his
soul
not
a
whisper
not
a
rustle
rose
now
from
the
dark
figure
over
which
we
stooped
holmes
laid
his
hand
upon
him
and
held
it
up
again
with
an
exclamation
of
horror
the
gleam
of
the
match
which
he
struck
shone
upon
his
clotted
fingers
and
upon
the
ghastly
pool
which
widened
slowly
from
the
crushed
skull
of
the
victim
and
it
shone
upon
something
else
which
turned
our
hearts
sick
and
faint
within
us
the
body
of
sir
henry
baskerville
there
was
no
chance
of
either
of
us
forgetting
that
peculiar
ruddy
tweed
suit
the
very
one
which
he
had
worn
on
the
first
morning
that
we
had
seen
him
in
baker
street
we
caught
the
one
clear
glimpse
of
it
and
then
the
match
flickered
and
went
out
even
as
the
hope
had
gone
out
of
our
souls
holmes
groaned
and
his
face
glimmered
white
through
the
darkness
the
brute
the
brute
i
cried
with
clenched
hands
oh
holmes
i
shall
never
forgive
myself
for
having
left
him
to
his
fate
i
am
more
to
blame
than
you
watson
in
order
to
have
my
case
well
rounded
and
complete
i
have
thrown
away
the
life
of
my
client
it
is
the
greatest
blow
which
has
befallen
me
in
my
career
but
how
could
i
know
how
could
i
know
that
he
would
risk
his
life
alone
upon
the
moor
in
the
face
of
all
my
warnings
that
we
should
have
heard
his
screams
my
god
those
screams
and
yet
have
been
unable
to
save
him
where
is
this
brute
of
a
hound
which
drove
him
to
his
death
it
may
be
lurking
among
these
rocks
at
this
instant
and
stapleton
where
is
he
he
shall
answer
for
this
deed
he
shall
i
will
see
to
that
uncle
and
nephew
have
been
murdered
the
one
frightened
to
death
by
the
very
sight
of
a
beast
which
he
thought
to
be
supernatural
the
other
driven
to
his
end
in
his
wild
flight
to
escape
from
it
but
now
we
have
to
prove
the
connection
between
the
man
and
the
beast
save
from
what
we
heard
we
cannot
even
swear
to
the
existence
of
the
latter
since
sir
henry
has
evidently
died
from
the
fall
but
by
heavens
cunning
as
he
is
the
fellow
shall
be
in
my
power
before
another
day
is
past
we
stood
with
bitter
hearts
on
either
side
of
the
mangled
body
overwhelmed
by
this
sudden
and
irrevocable
disaster
which
had
brought
all
our
long
and
weary
labours
to
so
piteous
an
end
then
as
the
moon
rose
we
climbed
to
the
top
of
the
rocks
over
which
our
poor
friend
had
fallen
and
from
the
summit
we
gazed
out
over
the
shadowy
moor
half
silver
and
half
gloom
far
away
miles
off
in
the
direction
of
grimpen
a
single
steady
yellow
light
was
shining
it
could
only
come
from
the
lonely
abode
of
the
stapletons
with
a
bitter
curse
i
shook
my
fist
at
it
as
i
gazed
why
should
we
not
seize
him
at
once
our
case
is
not
complete
the
fellow
is
wary
and
cunning
to
the
last
degree
it
is
not
what
we
know
but
what
we
can
prove
if
we
make
one
false
move
the
villain
may
escape
us
yet
what
can
we
do
there
will
be
plenty
for
us
to
do
tomorrow
tonight
we
can
only
perform
the
last
offices
to
our
poor
friend
together
we
made
our
way
down
the
precipitous
slope
and
approached
the
body
black
and
clear
against
the
silvered
stones
the
agony
of
those
contorted
limbs
struck
me
with
a
spasm
of
pain
and
blurred
my
eyes
with
tears
we
must
send
for
help
holmes
we
cannot
carry
him
all
the
way
to
the
hall
good
heavens
are
you
mad
he
had
uttered
a
cry
and
bent
over
the
body
now
he
was
dancing
and
laughing
and
wringing
my
hand
could
this
be
my
stern
self
contained
friend
these
were
hidden
fires
indeed
a
beard
a
beard
the
man
has
a
beard
a
beard
it
is
not
the
baronet
it
is
why
it
is
my
neighbour
the
convict
with
feverish
haste
we
had
turned
the
body
over
and
that
dripping
beard
was
pointing
up
to
the
cold
clear
moon
there
could
be
no
doubt
about
the
beetling
forehead
the
sunken
animal
eyes
it
was
indeed
the
same
face
which
had
glared
upon
me
in
the
light
of
the
candle
from
over
the
rock
the
face
of
selden
the
criminal
then
in
an
instant
it
was
all
clear
to
me
i
remembered
how
the
baronet
had
told
me
that
he
had
handed
his
old
wardrobe
to
barrymore
barrymore
had
passed
it
on
in
order
to
help
selden
in
his
escape
boots
shirt
cap
it
was
all
sir
henrys
the
tragedy
was
still
black
enough
but
this
man
had
at
least
deserved
death
by
the
laws
of
his
country
i
told
holmes
how
the
matter
stood
my
heart
bubbling
over
with
thankfulness
and
joy
then
the
clothes
have
been
the
poor
devils
death
said
he
it
is
clear
enough
that
the
hound
has
been
laid
on
from
some
article
of
sir
henrys
the
boot
which
was
abstracted
in
the
hotel
in
all
probability
and
so
ran
this
man
down
there
is
one
very
singular
thing
however
how
came
selden
in
the
darkness
to
know
that
the
hound
was
on
his
trail
he
heard
him
to
hear
a
hound
upon
the
moor
would
not
work
a
hard
man
like
this
convict
into
such
a
paroxysm
of
terror
that
he
would
risk
recapture
by
screaming
wildly
for
help
by
his
cries
he
must
have
run
a
long
way
after
he
knew
the
animal
was
on
his
track
how
did
he
know
a
greater
mystery
to
me
is
why
this
hound
presuming
that
all
our
conjectures
are
correct
i
presume
nothing
well
then
why
this
hound
should
be
loose
tonight
i
suppose
that
it
does
not
always
run
loose
upon
the
moor
stapleton
would
not
let
it
go
unless
he
had
reason
to
think
that
sir
henry
would
be
there
my
difficulty
is
the
more
formidable
of
the
two
for
i
think
that
we
shall
very
shortly
get
an
explanation
of
yours
while
mine
may
remain
forever
a
mystery
the
question
now
is
what
shall
we
do
with
this
poor
wretchs
body
we
cannot
leave
it
here
to
the
foxes
and
the
ravens
i
suggest
that
we
put
it
in
one
of
the
huts
until
we
can
communicate
with
the
police
exactly
i
have
no
doubt
that
you
and
i
could
carry
it
so
far
halloa
watson
whats
this
its
the
man
himself
by
all
thats
wonderful
and
audacious
not
a
word
to
show
your
suspicions
not
a
word
or
my
plans
crumble
to
the
ground
a
figure
was
approaching
us
over
the
moor
and
i
saw
the
dull
red
glow
of
a
cigar
the
moon
shone
upon
him
and
i
could
distinguish
the
dapper
shape
and
jaunty
walk
of
the
naturalist
he
stopped
when
he
saw
us
and
then
came
on
again
why
dr
watson
thats
not
you
is
it
you
are
the
last
man
that
i
should
have
expected
to
see
out
on
the
moor
at
this
time
of
night
but
dear
me
whats
this
somebody
hurt
not
dont
tell
me
that
it
is
our
friend
sir
henry
he
hurried
past
me
and
stooped
over
the
dead
man
i
heard
a
sharp
intake
of
his
breath
and
the
cigar
fell
from
his
fingers
who
whos
this
he
stammered
it
is
selden
the
man
who
escaped
from
princetown
stapleton
turned
a
ghastly
face
upon
us
but
by
a
supreme
effort
he
had
overcome
his
amazement
and
his
disappointment
he
looked
sharply
from
holmes
to
me
dear
me
what
a
very
shocking
affair
how
did
he
die
he
appears
to
have
broken
his
neck
by
falling
over
these
rocks
my
friend
and
i
were
strolling
on
the
moor
when
we
heard
a
cry
i
heard
a
cry
also
that
was
what
brought
me
out
i
was
uneasy
about
sir
henry
why
about
sir
henry
in
particular
i
could
not
help
asking
because
i
had
suggested
that
he
should
come
over
when
he
did
not
come
i
was
surprised
and
i
naturally
became
alarmed
for
his
safety
when
i
heard
cries
upon
the
moor
by
the
way
his
eyes
darted
again
from
my
face
to
holmess
did
you
hear
anything
else
besides
a
cry
no
said
holmes
did
you
no
what
do
you
mean
then
oh
you
know
the
stories
that
the
peasants
tell
about
a
phantom
hound
and
so
on
it
is
said
to
be
heard
at
night
upon
the
moor
i
was
wondering
if
there
were
any
evidence
of
such
a
sound
tonight
we
heard
nothing
of
the
kind
said
i
and
what
is
your
theory
of
this
poor
fellows
death
i
have
no
doubt
that
anxiety
and
exposure
have
driven
him
off
his
head
he
has
rushed
about
the
moor
in
a
crazy
state
and
eventually
fallen
over
here
and
broken
his
neck
that
seems
the
most
reasonable
theory
said
stapleton
and
he
gave
a
sigh
which
i
took
to
indicate
his
relief
what
do
you
think
about
it
mr
sherlock
holmes
my
friend
bowed
his
compliments
you
are
quick
at
identification
said
he
we
have
been
expecting
you
in
these
parts
since
dr
watson
came
down
you
are
in
time
to
see
a
tragedy
yes
indeed
i
have
no
doubt
that
my
friends
explanation
will
cover
the
facts
i
will
take
an
unpleasant
remembrance
back
to
london
with
me
tomorrow
oh
you
return
tomorrow
that
is
my
intention
i
hope
your
visit
has
cast
some
light
upon
those
occurrences
which
have
puzzled
us
holmes
shrugged
his
shoulders
one
cannot
always
have
the
success
for
which
one
hopes
an
investigator
needs
facts
and
not
legends
or
rumours
it
has
not
been
a
satisfactory
case
my
friend
spoke
in
his
frankest
and
most
unconcerned
manner
stapleton
still
looked
hard
at
him
then
he
turned
to
me
i
would
suggest
carrying
this
poor
fellow
to
my
house
but
it
would
give
my
sister
such
a
fright
that
i
do
not
feel
justified
in
doing
it
i
think
that
if
we
put
something
over
his
face
he
will
be
safe
until
morning
and
so
it
was
arranged
resisting
stapletons
offer
of
hospitality
holmes
and
i
set
off
to
baskerville
hall
leaving
the
naturalist
to
return
alone
looking
back
we
saw
the
figure
moving
slowly
away
over
the
broad
moor
and
behind
him
that
one
black
smudge
on
the
silvered
slope
which
showed
where
the
man
was
lying
who
had
come
so
horribly
to
his
end
chapter
fixing
the
nets
were
at
close
grips
at
last
said
holmes
as
we
walked
together
across
the
moor
what
a
nerve
the
fellow
has
how
he
pulled
himself
together
in
the
face
of
what
must
have
been
a
paralyzing
shock
when
he
found
that
the
wrong
man
had
fallen
a
victim
to
his
plot
i
told
you
in
london
watson
and
i
tell
you
now
again
that
we
have
never
had
a
foeman
more
worthy
of
our
steel
i
am
sorry
that
he
has
seen
you
and
so
was
i
at
first
but
there
was
no
getting
out
of
it
what
effect
do
you
think
it
will
have
upon
his
plans
now
that
he
knows
you
are
here
it
may
cause
him
to
be
more
cautious
or
it
may
drive
him
to
desperate
measures
at
once
like
most
clever
criminals
he
may
be
too
confident
in
his
own
cleverness
and
imagine
that
he
has
completely
deceived
us
why
should
we
not
arrest
him
at
once
my
dear
watson
you
were
born
to
be
a
man
of
action
your
instinct
is
always
to
do
something
energetic
but
supposing
for
arguments
sake
that
we
had
him
arrested
tonight
what
on
earth
the
better
off
should
we
be
for
that
we
could
prove
nothing
against
him
theres
the
devilish
cunning
of
it
if
he
were
acting
through
a
human
agent
we
could
get
some
evidence
but
if
we
were
to
drag
this
great
dog
to
the
light
of
day
it
would
not
help
us
in
putting
a
rope
round
the
neck
of
its
master
surely
we
have
a
case
not
a
shadow
of
one
only
surmise
and
conjecture
we
should
be
laughed
out
of
court
if
we
came
with
such
a
story
and
such
evidence
there
is
sir
charless
death
found
dead
without
a
mark
upon
him
you
and
i
know
that
he
died
of
sheer
fright
and
we
know
also
what
frightened
him
but
how
are
we
to
get
twelve
stolid
jurymen
to
know
it
what
signs
are
there
of
a
hound
where
are
the
marks
of
its
fangs
of
course
we
know
that
a
hound
does
not
bite
a
dead
body
and
that
sir
charles
was
dead
before
ever
the
brute
overtook
him
but
we
have
to
prove
all
this
and
we
are
not
in
a
position
to
do
it
well
then
tonight
we
are
not
much
better
off
tonight
again
there
was
no
direct
connection
between
the
hound
and
the
mans
death
we
never
saw
the
hound
we
heard
it
but
we
could
not
prove
that
it
was
running
upon
this
mans
trail
there
is
a
complete
absence
of
motive
no
my
dear
fellow
we
must
reconcile
ourselves
to
the
fact
that
we
have
no
case
at
present
and
that
it
is
worth
our
while
to
run
any
risk
in
order
to
establish
one
and
how
do
you
propose
to
do
so
i
have
great
hopes
of
what
mrs
laura
lyons
may
do
for
us
when
the
position
of
affairs
is
made
clear
to
her
and
i
have
my
own
plan
as
well
sufficient
for
tomorrow
is
the
evil
thereof
but
i
hope
before
the
day
is
past
to
have
the
upper
hand
at
last
i
could
draw
nothing
further
from
him
and
he
walked
lost
in
thought
as
far
as
the
baskerville
gates
are
you
coming
up
yes
i
see
no
reason
for
further
concealment
but
one
last
word
watson
say
nothing
of
the
hound
to
sir
henry
let
him
think
that
seldens
death
was
as
stapleton
would
have
us
believe
he
will
have
a
better
nerve
for
the
ordeal
which
he
will
have
to
undergo
tomorrow
when
he
is
engaged
if
i
remember
your
report
aright
to
dine
with
these
people
and
so
am
i
then
you
must
excuse
yourself
and
he
must
go
alone
that
will
be
easily
arranged
and
now
if
we
are
too
late
for
dinner
i
think
that
we
are
both
ready
for
our
suppers
sir
henry
was
more
pleased
than
surprised
to
see
sherlock
holmes
for
he
had
for
some
days
been
expecting
that
recent
events
would
bring
him
down
from
london
he
did
raise
his
eyebrows
however
when
he
found
that
my
friend
had
neither
any
luggage
nor
any
explanations
for
its
absence
between
us
we
soon
supplied
his
wants
and
then
over
a
belated
supper
we
explained
to
the
baronet
as
much
of
our
experience
as
it
seemed
desirable
that
he
should
know
but
first
i
had
the
unpleasant
duty
of
breaking
the
news
to
barrymore
and
his
wife
to
him
it
may
have
been
an
unmitigated
relief
but
she
wept
bitterly
in
her
apron
to
all
the
world
he
was
the
man
of
violence
half
animal
and
half
demon
but
to
her
he
always
remained
the
little
wilful
boy
of
her
own
girlhood
the
child
who
had
clung
to
her
hand
evil
indeed
is
the
man
who
has
not
one
woman
to
mourn
him
ive
been
moping
in
the
house
all
day
since
watson
went
off
in
the
morning
said
the
baronet
i
guess
i
should
have
some
credit
for
i
have
kept
my
promise
if
i
hadnt
sworn
not
to
go
about
alone
i
might
have
had
a
more
lively
evening
for
i
had
a
message
from
stapleton
asking
me
over
there
i
have
no
doubt
that
you
would
have
had
a
more
lively
evening
said
holmes
drily
by
the
way
i
dont
suppose
you
appreciate
that
we
have
been
mourning
over
you
as
having
broken
your
neck
sir
henry
opened
his
eyes
how
was
that
this
poor
wretch
was
dressed
in
your
clothes
i
fear
your
servant
who
gave
them
to
him
may
get
into
trouble
with
the
police
that
is
unlikely
there
was
no
mark
on
any
of
them
as
far
as
i
know
thats
lucky
for
him
in
fact
its
lucky
for
all
of
you
since
you
are
all
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
law
in
this
matter
i
am
not
sure
that
as
a
conscientious
detective
my
first
duty
is
not
to
arrest
the
whole
household
watsons
reports
are
most
incriminating
documents
but
how
about
the
case
asked
the
baronet
have
you
made
anything
out
of
the
tangle
i
dont
know
that
watson
and
i
are
much
the
wiser
since
we
came
down
i
think
that
i
shall
be
in
a
position
to
make
the
situation
rather
more
clear
to
you
before
long
it
has
been
an
exceedingly
difficult
and
most
complicated
business
there
are
several
points
upon
which
we
still
want
light
but
it
is
coming
all
the
same
weve
had
one
experience
as
watson
has
no
doubt
told
you
we
heard
the
hound
on
the
moor
so
i
can
swear
that
it
is
not
all
empty
superstition
i
had
something
to
do
with
dogs
when
i
was
out
west
and
i
know
one
when
i
hear
one
if
you
can
muzzle
that
one
and
put
him
on
a
chain
ill
be
ready
to
swear
you
are
the
greatest
detective
of
all
time
i
think
i
will
muzzle
him
and
chain
him
all
right
if
you
will
give
me
your
help
whatever
you
tell
me
to
do
i
will
do
very
good
and
i
will
ask
you
also
to
do
it
blindly
without
always
asking
the
reason
just
as
you
like
if
you
will
do
this
i
think
the
chances
are
that
our
little
problem
will
soon
be
solved
i
have
no
doubt
he
stopped
suddenly
and
stared
fixedly
up
over
my
head
into
the
air
the
lamp
beat
upon
his
face
and
so
intent
was
it
and
so
still
that
it
might
have
been
that
of
a
clear
cut
classical
statue
a
personification
of
alertness
and
expectation
what
is
it
we
both
cried
i
could
see
as
he
looked
down
that
he
was
repressing
some
internal
emotion
his
features
were
still
composed
but
his
eyes
shone
with
amused
exultation
excuse
the
admiration
of
a
connoisseur
said
he
as
he
waved
his
hand
towards
the
line
of
portraits
which
covered
the
opposite
wall
watson
wont
allow
that
i
know
anything
of
art
but
that
is
mere
jealousy
because
our
views
upon
the
subject
differ
now
these
are
a
really
very
fine
series
of
portraits
well
im
glad
to
hear
you
say
so
said
sir
henry
glancing
with
some
surprise
at
my
friend
i
dont
pretend
to
know
much
about
these
things
and
id
be
a
better
judge
of
a
horse
or
a
steer
than
of
a
picture
i
didnt
know
that
you
found
time
for
such
things
i
know
what
is
good
when
i
see
it
and
i
see
it
now
thats
a
kneller
ill
swear
that
lady
in
the
blue
silk
over
yonder
and
the
stout
gentleman
with
the
wig
ought
to
be
a
reynolds
they
are
all
family
portraits
i
presume
every
one
do
you
know
the
names
barrymore
has
been
coaching
me
in
them
and
i
think
i
can
say
my
lessons
fairly
well
who
is
the
gentleman
with
the
telescope
that
is
rear
admiral
baskerville
who
served
under
rodney
in
the
west
indies
the
man
with
the
blue
coat
and
the
roll
of
paper
is
sir
william
baskerville
who
was
chairman
of
committees
of
the
house
of
commons
under
pitt
and
this
cavalier
opposite
to
me
the
one
with
the
black
velvet
and
the
lace
ah
you
have
a
right
to
know
about
him
that
is
the
cause
of
all
the
mischief
the
wicked
hugo
who
started
the
hound
of
the
baskervilles
were
not
likely
to
forget
him
i
gazed
with
interest
and
some
surprise
upon
the
portrait
dear
me
said
holmes
he
seems
a
quiet
meek
mannered
man
enough
but
i
dare
say
that
there
was
a
lurking
devil
in
his
eyes
i
had
pictured
him
as
a
more
robust
and
ruffianly
person
theres
no
doubt
about
the
authenticity
for
the
name
and
the
date
are
on
the
back
of
the
canvas
holmes
said
little
more
but
the
picture
of
the
old
roysterer
seemed
to
have
a
fascination
for
him
and
his
eyes
were
continually
fixed
upon
it
during
supper
it
was
not
until
later
when
sir
henry
had
gone
to
his
room
that
i
was
able
to
follow
the
trend
of
his
thoughts
he
led
me
back
into
the
banqueting
hall
his
bedroom
candle
in
his
hand
and
he
held
it
up
against
the
time
stained
portrait
on
the
wall
do
you
see
anything
there
i
looked
at
the
broad
plumed
hat
the
curling
love
locks
the
white
lace
collar
and
the
straight
severe
face
which
was
framed
between
them
it
was
not
a
brutal
countenance
but
it
was
prim
hard
and
stern
with
a
firm
set
thin
lipped
mouth
and
a
coldly
intolerant
eye
is
it
like
anyone
you
know
there
is
something
of
sir
henry
about
the
jaw
just
a
suggestion
perhaps
but
wait
an
instant
he
stood
upon
a
chair
and
holding
up
the
light
in
his
left
hand
he
curved
his
right
arm
over
the
broad
hat
and
round
the
long
ringlets
good
heavens
i
cried
in
amazement
the
face
of
stapleton
had
sprung
out
of
the
canvas
ha
you
see
it
now
my
eyes
have
been
trained
to
examine
faces
and
not
their
trimmings
it
is
the
first
quality
of
a
criminal
investigator
that
he
should
see
through
a
disguise
but
this
is
marvellous
it
might
be
his
portrait
yes
it
is
an
interesting
instance
of
a
throwback
which
appears
to
be
both
physical
and
spiritual
a
study
of
family
portraits
is
enough
to
convert
a
man
to
the
doctrine
of
reincarnation
the
fellow
is
a
baskerville
that
is
evident
with
designs
upon
the
succession
exactly
this
chance
of
the
picture
has
supplied
us
with
one
of
our
most
obvious
missing
links
we
have
him
watson
we
have
him
and
i
dare
swear
that
before
tomorrow
night
he
will
be
fluttering
in
our
net
as
helpless
as
one
of
his
own
butterflies
a
pin
a
cork
and
a
card
and
we
add
him
to
the
baker
street
collection
he
burst
into
one
of
his
rare
fits
of
laughter
as
he
turned
away
from
the
picture
i
have
not
heard
him
laugh
often
and
it
has
always
boded
ill
to
somebody
i
was
up
betimes
in
the
morning
but
holmes
was
afoot
earlier
still
for
i
saw
him
as
i
dressed
coming
up
the
drive
yes
we
should
have
a
full
day
today
he
remarked
and
he
rubbed
his
hands
with
the
joy
of
action
the
nets
are
all
in
place
and
the
drag
is
about
to
begin
well
know
before
the
day
is
out
whether
we
have
caught
our
big
leanjawed
pike
or
whether
he
has
got
through
the
meshes
have
you
been
on
the
moor
already
i
have
sent
a
report
from
grimpen
to
princetown
as
to
the
death
of
selden
i
think
i
can
promise
that
none
of
you
will
be
troubled
in
the
matter
and
i
have
also
communicated
with
my
faithful
cartwright
who
would
certainly
have
pined
away
at
the
door
of
my
hut
as
a
dog
does
at
his
masters
grave
if
i
had
not
set
his
mind
at
rest
about
my
safety
what
is
the
next
move
to
see
sir
henry
ah
here
he
is
good
morning
holmes
said
the
baronet
you
look
like
a
general
who
is
planning
a
battle
with
his
chief
of
the
staff
that
is
the
exact
situation
watson
was
asking
for
orders
and
so
do
i
very
good
you
are
engaged
as
i
understand
to
dine
with
our
friends
the
stapletons
tonight
i
hope
that
you
will
come
also
they
are
very
hospitable
people
and
i
am
sure
that
they
would
be
very
glad
to
see
you
i
fear
that
watson
and
i
must
go
to
london
to
london
yes
i
think
that
we
should
be
more
useful
there
at
the
present
juncture
the
baronets
face
perceptibly
lengthened
i
hoped
that
you
were
going
to
see
me
through
this
business
the
hall
and
the
moor
are
not
very
pleasant
places
when
one
is
alone
my
dear
fellow
you
must
trust
me
implicitly
and
do
exactly
what
i
tell
you
you
can
tell
your
friends
that
we
should
have
been
happy
to
have
come
with
you
but
that
urgent
business
required
us
to
be
in
town
we
hope
very
soon
to
return
to
devonshire
will
you
remember
to
give
them
that
message
if
you
insist
upon
it
there
is
no
alternative
i
assure
you
i
saw
by
the
baronets
clouded
brow
that
he
was
deeply
hurt
by
what
he
regarded
as
our
desertion
when
do
you
desire
to
go
he
asked
coldly
immediately
after
breakfast
we
will
drive
in
to
coombe
tracey
but
watson
will
leave
his
things
as
a
pledge
that
he
will
come
back
to
you
watson
you
will
send
a
note
to
stapleton
to
tell
him
that
you
regret
that
you
cannot
come
i
have
a
good
mind
to
go
to
london
with
you
said
the
baronet
why
should
i
stay
here
alone
because
it
is
your
post
of
duty
because
you
gave
me
your
word
that
you
would
do
as
you
were
told
and
i
tell
you
to
stay
all
right
then
ill
stay
one
more
direction
i
wish
you
to
drive
to
merripit
house
send
back
your
trap
however
and
let
them
know
that
you
intend
to
walk
home
to
walk
across
the
moor
yes
but
that
is
the
very
thing
which
you
have
so
often
cautioned
me
not
to
do
this
time
you
may
do
it
with
safety
if
i
had
not
every
confidence
in
your
nerve
and
courage
i
would
not
suggest
it
but
it
is
essential
that
you
should
do
it
then
i
will
do
it
and
as
you
value
your
life
do
not
go
across
the
moor
in
any
direction
save
along
the
straight
path
which
leads
from
merripit
house
to
the
grimpen
road
and
is
your
natural
way
home
i
will
do
just
what
you
say
very
good
i
should
be
glad
to
get
away
as
soon
after
breakfast
as
possible
so
as
to
reach
london
in
the
afternoon
i
was
much
astounded
by
this
programme
though
i
remembered
that
holmes
had
said
to
stapleton
on
the
night
before
that
his
visit
would
terminate
next
day
it
had
not
crossed
my
mind
however
that
he
would
wish
me
to
go
with
him
nor
could
i
understand
how
we
could
both
be
absent
at
a
moment
which
he
himself
declared
to
be
critical
there
was
nothing
for
it
however
but
implicit
obedience
so
we
bade
good
bye
to
our
rueful
friend
and
a
couple
of
hours
afterwards
we
were
at
the
station
of
coombe
tracey
and
had
dispatched
the
trap
upon
its
return
journey
a
small
boy
was
waiting
upon
the
platform
any
orders
sir
you
will
take
this
train
to
town
cartwright
the
moment
you
arrive
you
will
send
a
wire
to
sir
henry
baskerville
in
my
name
to
say
that
if
he
finds
the
pocketbook
which
i
have
dropped
he
is
to
send
it
by
registered
post
to
baker
street
yes
sir
and
ask
at
the
station
office
if
there
is
a
message
for
me
the
boy
returned
with
a
telegram
which
holmes
handed
to
me
it
ran
wire
received
coming
down
with
unsigned
warrant
arrive
five
forty
lestrade
that
is
in
answer
to
mine
of
this
morning
he
is
the
best
of
the
professionals
i
think
and
we
may
need
his
assistance
now
watson
i
think
that
we
cannot
employ
our
time
better
than
by
calling
upon
your
acquaintance
mrs
laura
lyons
his
plan
of
campaign
was
beginning
to
be
evident
he
would
use
the
baronet
in
order
to
convince
the
stapletons
that
we
were
really
gone
while
we
should
actually
return
at
the
instant
when
we
were
likely
to
be
needed
that
telegram
from
london
if
mentioned
by
sir
henry
to
the
stapletons
must
remove
the
last
suspicions
from
their
minds
already
i
seemed
to
see
our
nets
drawing
closer
around
that
leanjawed
pike
mrs
laura
lyons
was
in
her
office
and
sherlock
holmes
opened
his
interview
with
a
frankness
and
directness
which
considerably
amazed
her
i
am
investigating
the
circumstances
which
attended
the
death
of
the
late
sir
charles
baskerville
said
he
my
friend
here
dr
watson
has
informed
me
of
what
you
have
communicated
and
also
of
what
you
have
withheld
in
connection
with
that
matter
what
have
i
withheld
she
asked
defiantly
you
have
confessed
that
you
asked
sir
charles
to
be
at
the
gate
at
ten
oclock
we
know
that
that
was
the
place
and
hour
of
his
death
you
have
withheld
what
the
connection
is
between
these
events
there
is
no
connection
in
that
case
the
coincidence
must
indeed
be
an
extraordinary
one
but
i
think
that
we
shall
succeed
in
establishing
a
connection
after
all
i
wish
to
be
perfectly
frank
with
you
mrs
lyons
we
regard
this
case
as
one
of
murder
and
the
evidence
may
implicate
not
only
your
friend
mr
stapleton
but
his
wife
as
well
the
lady
sprang
from
her
chair
his
wife
she
cried
the
fact
is
no
longer
a
secret
the
person
who
has
passed
for
his
sister
is
really
his
wife
mrs
lyons
had
resumed
her
seat
her
hands
were
grasping
the
arms
of
her
chair
and
i
saw
that
the
pink
nails
had
turned
white
with
the
pressure
of
her
grip
his
wife
she
said
again
his
wife
he
is
not
a
married
man
sherlock
holmes
shrugged
his
shoulders
prove
it
to
me
prove
it
to
me
and
if
you
can
do
so
the
fierce
flash
of
her
eyes
said
more
than
any
words
i
have
come
prepared
to
do
so
said
holmes
drawing
several
papers
from
his
pocket
here
is
a
photograph
of
the
couple
taken
in
york
four
years
ago
it
is
indorsed
mr
and
mrs
vandeleur
but
you
will
have
no
difficulty
in
recognizing
him
and
her
also
if
you
know
her
by
sight
here
are
three
written
descriptions
by
trustworthy
witnesses
of
mr
and
mrs
vandeleur
who
at
that
time
kept
st
olivers
private
school
read
them
and
see
if
you
can
doubt
the
identity
of
these
people
she
glanced
at
them
and
then
looked
up
at
us
with
the
set
rigid
face
of
a
desperate
woman
mr
holmes
she
said
this
man
had
offered
me
marriage
on
condition
that
i
could
get
a
divorce
from
my
husband
he
has
lied
to
me
the
villain
in
every
conceivable
way
not
one
word
of
truth
has
he
ever
told
me
and
why
why
i
imagined
that
all
was
for
my
own
sake
but
now
i
see
that
i
was
never
anything
but
a
tool
in
his
hands
why
should
i
preserve
faith
with
him
who
never
kept
any
with
me
why
should
i
try
to
shield
him
from
the
consequences
of
his
own
wicked
acts
ask
me
what
you
like
and
there
is
nothing
which
i
shall
hold
back
one
thing
i
swear
to
you
and
that
is
that
when
i
wrote
the
letter
i
never
dreamed
of
any
harm
to
the
old
gentleman
who
had
been
my
kindest
friend
i
entirely
believe
you
madam
said
sherlock
holmes
the
recital
of
these
events
must
be
very
painful
to
you
and
perhaps
it
will
make
it
easier
if
i
tell
you
what
occurred
and
you
can
check
me
if
i
make
any
material
mistake
the
sending
of
this
letter
was
suggested
to
you
by
stapleton
he
dictated
it
i
presume
that
the
reason
he
gave
was
that
you
would
receive
help
from
sir
charles
for
the
legal
expenses
connected
with
your
divorce
exactly
and
then
after
you
had
sent
the
letter
he
dissuaded
you
from
keeping
the
appointment
he
told
me
that
it
would
hurt
his
self
respect
that
any
other
man
should
find
the
money
for
such
an
object
and
that
though
he
was
a
poor
man
himself
he
would
devote
his
last
penny
to
removing
the
obstacles
which
divided
us
he
appears
to
be
a
very
consistent
character
and
then
you
heard
nothing
until
you
read
the
reports
of
the
death
in
the
paper
no
and
he
made
you
swear
to
say
nothing
about
your
appointment
with
sir
charles
he
did
he
said
that
the
death
was
a
very
mysterious
one
and
that
i
should
certainly
be
suspected
if
the
facts
came
out
he
frightened
me
into
remaining
silent
quite
so
but
you
had
your
suspicions
she
hesitated
and
looked
down
i
knew
him
she
said
but
if
he
had
kept
faith
with
me
i
should
always
have
done
so
with
him
i
think
that
on
the
whole
you
have
had
a
fortunate
escape
said
sherlock
holmes
you
have
had
him
in
your
power
and
he
knew
it
and
yet
you
are
alive
you
have
been
walking
for
some
months
very
near
to
the
edge
of
a
precipice
we
must
wish
you
good
morning
now
mrs
lyons
and
it
is
probable
that
you
will
very
shortly
hear
from
us
again
our
case
becomes
rounded
off
and
difficulty
after
difficulty
thins
away
in
front
of
us
said
holmes
as
we
stood
waiting
for
the
arrival
of
the
express
from
town
i
shall
soon
be
in
the
position
of
being
able
to
put
into
a
single
connected
narrative
one
of
the
most
singular
and
sensational
crimes
of
modern
times
students
of
criminology
will
remember
the
analogous
incidents
in
godno
in
little
russia
in
the
year
and
of
course
there
are
the
anderson
murders
in
north
carolina
but
this
case
possesses
some
features
which
are
entirely
its
own
even
now
we
have
no
clear
case
against
this
very
wily
man
but
i
shall
be
very
much
surprised
if
it
is
not
clear
enough
before
we
go
to
bed
this
night
the
london
express
came
roaring
into
the
station
and
a
small
wiry
bulldog
of
a
man
had
sprung
from
a
first
class
carriage
we
all
three
shook
hands
and
i
saw
at
once
from
the
reverential
way
in
which
lestrade
gazed
at
my
companion
that
he
had
learned
a
good
deal
since
the
days
when
they
had
first
worked
together
i
could
well
remember
the
scorn
which
the
theories
of
the
reasoner
used
then
to
excite
in
the
practical
man
anything
good
he
asked
the
biggest
thing
for
years
said
holmes
we
have
two
hours
before
we
need
think
of
starting
i
think
we
might
employ
it
in
getting
some
dinner
and
then
lestrade
we
will
take
the
london
fog
out
of
your
throat
by
giving
you
a
breath
of
the
pure
night
air
of
dartmoor
never
been
there
ah
well
i
dont
suppose
you
will
forget
your
first
visit
chapter
the
hound
of
the
baskervilles
one
of
sherlock
holmess
defects
if
indeed
one
may
call
it
a
defect
was
that
he
was
exceedingly
loath
to
communicate
his
full
plans
to
any
other
person
until
the
instant
of
their
fulfilment
partly
it
came
no
doubt
from
his
own
masterful
nature
which
loved
to
dominate
and
surprise
those
who
were
around
him
partly
also
from
his
professional
caution
which
urged
him
never
to
take
any
chances
the
result
however
was
very
trying
for
those
who
were
acting
as
his
agents
and
assistants
i
had
often
suffered
under
it
but
never
more
so
than
during
that
long
drive
in
the
darkness
the
great
ordeal
was
in
front
of
us
at
last
we
were
about
to
make
our
final
effort
and
yet
holmes
had
said
nothing
and
i
could
only
surmise
what
his
course
of
action
would
be
my
nerves
thrilled
with
anticipation
when
at
last
the
cold
wind
upon
our
faces
and
the
dark
void
spaces
on
either
side
of
the
narrow
road
told
me
that
we
were
back
upon
the
moor
once
again
every
stride
of
the
horses
and
every
turn
of
the
wheels
was
taking
us
nearer
to
our
supreme
adventure
our
conversation
was
hampered
by
the
presence
of
the
driver
of
the
hired
wagonette
so
that
we
were
forced
to
talk
of
trivial
matters
when
our
nerves
were
tense
with
emotion
and
anticipation
it
was
a
relief
to
me
after
that
unnatural
restraint
when
we
at
last
passed
frankland
house
and
knew
that
we
were
drawing
near
to
the
hall
and
to
the
scene
of
action
we
did
not
drive
up
to
the
door
but
got
down
near
the
gate
of
the
avenue
the
wagonette
was
paid
off
and
ordered
to
return
to
coombe
tracey
forthwith
while
we
started
to
walk
to
merripit
house
are
you
armed
lestrade
the
little
detective
smiled
as
long
as
i
have
my
trousers
i
have
a
hip
pocket
and
as
long
as
i
have
my
hip
pocket
i
have
something
in
it
good
my
friend
and
i
are
also
ready
for
emergencies
youre
mighty
close
about
this
affair
mr
holmes
whats
the
game
now
a
waiting
game
my
word
it
does
not
seem
a
very
cheerful
place
said
the
detective
with
a
shiver
glancing
round
him
at
the
gloomy
slopes
of
the
hill
and
at
the
huge
lake
of
fog
which
lay
over
the
grimpen
mire
i
see
the
lights
of
a
house
ahead
of
us
that
is
merripit
house
and
the
end
of
our
journey
i
must
request
you
to
walk
on
tiptoe
and
not
to
talk
above
a
whisper
we
moved
cautiously
along
the
track
as
if
we
were
bound
for
the
house
but
holmes
halted
us
when
we
were
about
two
hundred
yards
from
it
this
will
do
said
he
these
rocks
upon
the
right
make
an
admirable
screen
we
are
to
wait
here
yes
we
shall
make
our
little
ambush
here
get
into
this
hollow
lestrade
you
have
been
inside
the
house
have
you
not
watson
can
you
tell
the
position
of
the
rooms
what
are
those
latticed
windows
at
this
end
i
think
they
are
the
kitchen
windows
and
the
one
beyond
which
shines
so
brightly
that
is
certainly
the
dining
room
the
blinds
are
up
you
know
the
lie
of
the
land
best
creep
forward
quietly
and
see
what
they
are
doing
but
for
heavens
sake
dont
let
them
know
that
they
are
watched
i
tiptoed
down
the
path
and
stooped
behind
the
low
wall
which
surrounded
the
stunted
orchard
creeping
in
its
shadow
i
reached
a
point
whence
i
could
look
straight
through
the
uncurtained
window
there
were
only
two
men
in
the
room
sir
henry
and
stapleton
they
sat
with
their
profiles
towards
me
on
either
side
of
the
round
table
both
of
them
were
smoking
cigars
and
coffee
and
wine
were
in
front
of
them
stapleton
was
talking
with
animation
but
the
baronet
looked
pale
and
distrait
perhaps
the
thought
of
that
lonely
walk
across
the
ill
omened
moor
was
weighing
heavily
upon
his
mind
as
i
watched
them
stapleton
rose
and
left
the
room
while
sir
henry
filled
his
glass
again
and
leaned
back
in
his
chair
puffing
at
his
cigar
i
heard
the
creak
of
a
door
and
the
crisp
sound
of
boots
upon
gravel
the
steps
passed
along
the
path
on
the
other
side
of
the
wall
under
which
i
crouched
looking
over
i
saw
the
naturalist
pause
at
the
door
of
an
out
house
in
the
corner
of
the
orchard
a
key
turned
in
a
lock
and
as
he
passed
in
there
was
a
curious
scuffling
noise
from
within
he
was
only
a
minute
or
so
inside
and
then
i
heard
the
key
turn
once
more
and
he
passed
me
and
reentered
the
house
i
saw
him
rejoin
his
guest
and
i
crept
quietly
back
to
where
my
companions
were
waiting
to
tell
them
what
i
had
seen
you
say
watson
that
the
lady
is
not
there
holmes
asked
when
i
had
finished
my
report
no
where
can
she
be
then
since
there
is
no
light
in
any
other
room
except
the
kitchen
i
cannot
think
where
she
is
i
have
said
that
over
the
great
grimpen
mire
there
hung
a
dense
white
fog
it
was
drifting
slowly
in
our
direction
and
banked
itself
up
like
a
wall
on
that
side
of
us
low
but
thick
and
well
defined
the
moon
shone
on
it
and
it
looked
like
a
great
shimmering
ice
field
with
the
heads
of
the
distant
tors
as
rocks
borne
upon
its
surface
holmess
face
was
turned
towards
it
and
he
muttered
impatiently
as
he
watched
its
sluggish
drift
its
moving
towards
us
watson
is
that
serious
very
serious
indeed
the
one
thing
upon
earth
which
could
have
disarranged
my
plans
he
cant
be
very
long
now
it
is
already
ten
oclock
our
success
and
even
his
life
may
depend
upon
his
coming
out
before
the
fog
is
over
the
path
the
night
was
clear
and
fine
above
us
the
stars
shone
cold
and
bright
while
a
half
moon
bathed
the
whole
scene
in
a
soft
uncertain
light
before
us
lay
the
dark
bulk
of
the
house
its
serrated
roof
and
bristling
chimneys
hard
outlined
against
the
silver
spangled
sky
broad
bars
of
golden
light
from
the
lower
windows
stretched
across
the
orchard
and
the
moor
one
of
them
was
suddenly
shut
off
the
servants
had
left
the
kitchen
there
only
remained
the
lamp
in
the
dining
room
where
the
two
men
the
murderous
host
and
the
unconscious
guest
still
chatted
over
their
cigars
every
minute
that
white
woolly
plain
which
covered
one
half
of
the
moor
was
drifting
closer
and
closer
to
the
house
already
the
first
thin
wisps
of
it
were
curling
across
the
golden
square
of
the
lighted
window
the
farther
wall
of
the
orchard
was
already
invisible
and
the
trees
were
standing
out
of
a
swirl
of
white
vapour
as
we
watched
it
the
fog
wreaths
came
crawling
round
both
corners
of
the
house
and
rolled
slowly
into
one
dense
bank
on
which
the
upper
floor
and
the
roof
floated
like
a
strange
ship
upon
a
shadowy
sea
holmes
struck
his
hand
passionately
upon
the
rock
in
front
of
us
and
stamped
his
feet
in
his
impatience
if
he
isnt
out
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
the
path
will
be
covered
in
half
an
hour
we
wont
be
able
to
see
our
hands
in
front
of
us
shall
we
move
farther
back
upon
higher
ground
yes
i
think
it
would
be
as
well
so
as
the
fog
bank
flowed
onward
we
fell
back
before
it
until
we
were
half
a
mile
from
the
house
and
still
that
dense
white
sea
with
the
moon
silvering
its
upper
edge
swept
slowly
and
inexorably
on
we
are
going
too
far
said
holmes
we
dare
not
take
the
chance
of
his
being
overtaken
before
he
can
reach
us
at
all
costs
we
must
hold
our
ground
where
we
are
he
dropped
on
his
knees
and
clapped
his
ear
to
the
ground
thank
god
i
think
that
i
hear
him
coming
a
sound
of
quick
steps
broke
the
silence
of
the
moor
crouching
among
the
stones
we
stared
intently
at
the
silver
tipped
bank
in
front
of
us
the
steps
grew
louder
and
through
the
fog
as
through
a
curtain
there
stepped
the
man
whom
we
were
awaiting
he
looked
round
him
in
surprise
as
he
emerged
into
the
clear
starlit
night
then
he
came
swiftly
along
the
path
passed
close
to
where
we
lay
and
went
on
up
the
long
slope
behind
us
as
he
walked
he
glanced
continually
over
either
shoulder
like
a
man
who
is
ill
at
ease
hist
cried
holmes
and
i
heard
the
sharp
click
of
a
cocking
pistol
look
out
its
coming
there
was
a
thin
crisp
continuous
patter
from
somewhere
in
the
heart
of
that
crawling
bank
the
cloud
was
within
fifty
yards
of
where
we
lay
and
we
glared
at
it
all
three
uncertain
what
horror
was
about
to
break
from
the
heart
of
it
i
was
at
holmess
elbow
and
i
glanced
for
an
instant
at
his
face
it
was
pale
and
exultant
his
eyes
shining
brightly
in
the
moonlight
but
suddenly
they
started
forward
in
a
rigid
fixed
stare
and
his
lips
parted
in
amazement
at
the
same
instant
lestrade
gave
a
yell
of
terror
and
threw
himself
face
downward
upon
the
ground
i
sprang
to
my
feet
my
inert
hand
grasping
my
pistol
my
mind
paralyzed
by
the
dreadful
shape
which
had
sprung
out
upon
us
from
the
shadows
of
the
fog
a
hound
it
was
an
enormous
coal
black
hound
but
not
such
a
hound
as
mortal
eyes
have
ever
seen
fire
burst
from
its
open
mouth
its
eyes
glowed
with
a
smouldering
glare
its
muzzle
and
hackles
and
dewlap
were
outlined
in
flickering
flame
never
in
the
delirious
dream
of
a
disordered
brain
could
anything
more
savage
more
appalling
more
hellish
be
conceived
than
that
dark
form
and
savage
face
which
broke
upon
us
out
of
the
wall
of
fog
with
long
bounds
the
huge
black
creature
was
leaping
down
the
track
following
hard
upon
the
footsteps
of
our
friend
so
paralyzed
were
we
by
the
apparition
that
we
allowed
him
to
pass
before
we
had
recovered
our
nerve
then
holmes
and
i
both
fired
together
and
the
creature
gave
a
hideous
howl
which
showed
that
one
at
least
had
hit
him
he
did
not
pause
however
but
bounded
onward
far
away
on
the
path
we
saw
sir
henry
looking
back
his
face
white
in
the
moonlight
his
hands
raised
in
horror
glaring
helplessly
at
the
frightful
thing
which
was
hunting
him
down
but
that
cry
of
pain
from
the
hound
had
blown
all
our
fears
to
the
winds
if
he
was
vulnerable
he
was
mortal
and
if
we
could
wound
him
we
could
kill
him
never
have
i
seen
a
man
run
as
holmes
ran
that
night
i
am
reckoned
fleet
of
foot
but
he
outpaced
me
as
much
as
i
outpaced
the
little
professional
in
front
of
us
as
we
flew
up
the
track
we
heard
scream
after
scream
from
sir
henry
and
the
deep
roar
of
the
hound
i
was
in
time
to
see
the
beast
spring
upon
its
victim
hurl
him
to
the
ground
and
worry
at
his
throat
but
the
next
instant
holmes
had
emptied
five
barrels
of
his
revolver
into
the
creatures
flank
with
a
last
howl
of
agony
and
a
vicious
snap
in
the
air
it
rolled
upon
its
back
four
feet
pawing
furiously
and
then
fell
limp
upon
its
side
i
stooped
panting
and
pressed
my
pistol
to
the
dreadful
shimmering
head
but
it
was
useless
to
press
the
trigger
the
giant
hound
was
dead
sir
henry
lay
insensible
where
he
had
fallen
we
tore
away
his
collar
and
holmes
breathed
a
prayer
of
gratitude
when
we
saw
that
there
was
no
sign
of
a
wound
and
that
the
rescue
had
been
in
time
already
our
friends
eyelids
shivered
and
he
made
a
feeble
effort
to
move
lestrade
thrust
his
brandy
flask
between
the
baronets
teeth
and
two
frightened
eyes
were
looking
up
at
us
my
god
he
whispered
what
was
it
what
in
heavens
name
was
it
its
dead
whatever
it
is
said
holmes
weve
laid
the
family
ghost
once
and
forever
in
mere
size
and
strength
it
was
a
terrible
creature
which
was
lying
stretched
before
us
it
was
not
a
pure
bloodhound
and
it
was
not
a
pure
mastiff
but
it
appeared
to
be
a
combination
of
the
two
gaunt
savage
and
as
large
as
a
small
lioness
even
now
in
the
stillness
of
death
the
huge
jaws
seemed
to
be
dripping
with
a
bluish
flame
and
the
small
deep
set
cruel
eyes
were
ringed
with
fire
i
placed
my
hand
upon
the
glowing
muzzle
and
as
i
held
them
up
my
own
fingers
smouldered
and
gleamed
in
the
darkness
phosphorus
i
said
a
cunning
preparation
of
it
said
holmes
sniffing
at
the
dead
animal
there
is
no
smell
which
might
have
interfered
with
his
power
of
scent
we
owe
you
a
deep
apology
sir
henry
for
having
exposed
you
to
this
fright
i
was
prepared
for
a
hound
but
not
for
such
a
creature
as
this
and
the
fog
gave
us
little
time
to
receive
him
you
have
saved
my
life
having
first
endangered
it
are
you
strong
enough
to
stand
give
me
another
mouthful
of
that
brandy
and
i
shall
be
ready
for
anything
so
now
if
you
will
help
me
up
what
do
you
propose
to
do
to
leave
you
here
you
are
not
fit
for
further
adventures
tonight
if
you
will
wait
one
or
other
of
us
will
go
back
with
you
to
the
hall
he
tried
to
stagger
to
his
feet
but
he
was
still
ghastly
pale
and
trembling
in
every
limb
we
helped
him
to
a
rock
where
he
sat
shivering
with
his
face
buried
in
his
hands
we
must
leave
you
now
said
holmes
the
rest
of
our
work
must
be
done
and
every
moment
is
of
importance
we
have
our
case
and
now
we
only
want
our
man
its
a
thousand
to
one
against
our
finding
him
at
the
house
he
continued
as
we
retraced
our
steps
swiftly
down
the
path
those
shots
must
have
told
him
that
the
game
was
up
we
were
some
distance
off
and
this
fog
may
have
deadened
them
he
followed
the
hound
to
call
him
off
of
that
you
may
be
certain
no
no
hes
gone
by
this
time
but
well
search
the
house
and
make
sure
the
front
door
was
open
so
we
rushed
in
and
hurried
from
room
to
room
to
the
amazement
of
a
doddering
old
manservant
who
met
us
in
the
passage
there
was
no
light
save
in
the
dining
room
but
holmes
caught
up
the
lamp
and
left
no
corner
of
the
house
unexplored
no
sign
could
we
see
of
the
man
whom
we
were
chasing
on
the
upper
floor
however
one
of
the
bedroom
doors
was
locked
theres
someone
in
here
cried
lestrade
i
can
hear
a
movement
open
this
door
a
faint
moaning
and
rustling
came
from
within
holmes
struck
the
door
just
over
the
lock
with
the
flat
of
his
foot
and
it
flew
open
pistol
in
hand
we
all
three
rushed
into
the
room
but
there
was
no
sign
within
it
of
that
desperate
and
defiant
villain
whom
we
expected
to
see
instead
we
were
faced
by
an
object
so
strange
and
so
unexpected
that
we
stood
for
a
moment
staring
at
it
in
amazement
the
room
had
been
fashioned
into
a
small
museum
and
the
walls
were
lined
by
a
number
of
glass
topped
cases
full
of
that
collection
of
butterflies
and
moths
the
formation
of
which
had
been
the
relaxation
of
this
complex
and
dangerous
man
in
the
centre
of
this
room
there
was
an
upright
beam
which
had
been
placed
at
some
period
as
a
support
for
the
old
worm
eaten
baulk
of
timber
which
spanned
the
roof
to
this
post
a
figure
was
tied
so
swathed
and
muffled
in
the
sheets
which
had
been
used
to
secure
it
that
one
could
not
for
the
moment
tell
whether
it
was
that
of
a
man
or
a
woman
one
towel
passed
round
the
throat
and
was
secured
at
the
back
of
the
pillar
another
covered
the
lower
part
of
the
face
and
over
it
two
dark
eyes
eyes
full
of
grief
and
shame
and
a
dreadful
questioning
stared
back
at
us
in
a
minute
we
had
torn
off
the
gag
unswathed
the
bonds
and
mrs
stapleton
sank
upon
the
floor
in
front
of
us
as
her
beautiful
head
fell
upon
her
chest
i
saw
the
clear
red
weal
of
a
whiplash
across
her
neck
the
brute
cried
holmes
here
lestrade
your
brandy
bottle
put
her
in
the
chair
she
has
fainted
from
ill
usage
and
exhaustion
she
opened
her
eyes
again
is
he
safe
she
asked
has
he
escaped
he
cannot
escape
us
madam
no
no
i
did
not
mean
my
husband
sir
henry
is
he
safe
yes
and
the
hound
it
is
dead
she
gave
a
long
sigh
of
satisfaction
thank
god
thank
god
oh
this
villain
see
how
he
has
treated
me
she
shot
her
arms
out
from
her
sleeves
and
we
saw
with
horror
that
they
were
all
mottled
with
bruises
but
this
is
nothing
nothing
it
is
my
mind
and
soul
that
he
has
tortured
and
defiled
i
could
endure
it
all
ill
usage
solitude
a
life
of
deception
everything
as
long
as
i
could
still
cling
to
the
hope
that
i
had
his
love
but
now
i
know
that
in
this
also
i
have
been
his
dupe
and
his
tool
she
broke
into
passionate
sobbing
as
she
spoke
you
bear
him
no
good
will
madam
said
holmes
tell
us
then
where
we
shall
find
him
if
you
have
ever
aided
him
in
evil
help
us
now
and
so
atone
there
is
but
one
place
where
he
can
have
fled
she
answered
there
is
an
old
tin
mine
on
an
island
in
the
heart
of
the
mire
it
was
there
that
he
kept
his
hound
and
there
also
he
had
made
preparations
so
that
he
might
have
a
refuge
that
is
where
he
would
fly
the
fog
bank
lay
like
white
wool
against
the
window
holmes
held
the
lamp
towards
it
see
said
he
no
one
could
find
his
way
into
the
grimpen
mire
tonight
she
laughed
and
clapped
her
hands
her
eyes
and
teeth
gleamed
with
fierce
merriment
he
may
find
his
way
in
but
never
out
she
cried
how
can
he
see
the
guiding
wands
tonight
we
planted
them
together
he
and
i
to
mark
the
pathway
through
the
mire
oh
if
i
could
only
have
plucked
them
out
today
then
indeed
you
would
have
had
him
at
your
mercy
it
was
evident
to
us
that
all
pursuit
was
in
vain
until
the
fog
had
lifted
meanwhile
we
left
lestrade
in
possession
of
the
house
while
holmes
and
i
went
back
with
the
baronet
to
baskerville
hall
the
story
of
the
stapletons
could
no
longer
be
withheld
from
him
but
he
took
the
blow
bravely
when
he
learned
the
truth
about
the
woman
whom
he
had
loved
but
the
shock
of
the
nights
adventures
had
shattered
his
nerves
and
before
morning
he
lay
delirious
in
a
high
fever
under
the
care
of
dr
mortimer
the
two
of
them
were
destined
to
travel
together
round
the
world
before
sir
henry
had
become
once
more
the
hale
hearty
man
that
he
had
been
before
he
became
master
of
that
ill
omened
estate
and
now
i
come
rapidly
to
the
conclusion
of
this
singular
narrative
in
which
i
have
tried
to
make
the
reader
share
those
dark
fears
and
vague
surmises
which
clouded
our
lives
so
long
and
ended
in
so
tragic
a
manner
on
the
morning
after
the
death
of
the
hound
the
fog
had
lifted
and
we
were
guided
by
mrs
stapleton
to
the
point
where
they
had
found
a
pathway
through
the
bog
it
helped
us
to
realize
the
horror
of
this
womans
life
when
we
saw
the
eagerness
and
joy
with
which
she
laid
us
on
her
husbands
track
we
left
her
standing
upon
the
thin
peninsula
of
firm
peaty
soil
which
tapered
out
into
the
widespread
bog
from
the
end
of
it
a
small
wand
planted
here
and
there
showed
where
the
path
zigzagged
from
tuft
to
tuft
of
rushes
among
those
green
scummed
pits
and
foul
quagmires
which
barred
the
way
to
the
stranger
rank
reeds
and
lush
slimy
water
plants
sent
an
odour
of
decay
and
a
heavy
miasmatic
vapour
onto
our
faces
while
a
false
step
plunged
us
more
than
once
thigh
deep
into
the
dark
quivering
mire
which
shook
for
yards
in
soft
undulations
around
our
feet
its
tenacious
grip
plucked
at
our
heels
as
we
walked
and
when
we
sank
into
it
it
was
as
if
some
malignant
hand
was
tugging
us
down
into
those
obscene
depths
so
grim
and
purposeful
was
the
clutch
in
which
it
held
us
once
only
we
saw
a
trace
that
someone
had
passed
that
perilous
way
before
us
from
amid
a
tuft
of
cotton
grass
which
bore
it
up
out
of
the
slime
some
dark
thing
was
projecting
holmes
sank
to
his
waist
as
he
stepped
from
the
path
to
seize
it
and
had
we
not
been
there
to
drag
him
out
he
could
never
have
set
his
foot
upon
firm
land
again
he
held
an
old
black
boot
in
the
air
meyers
toronto
was
printed
on
the
leather
inside
it
is
worth
a
mud
bath
said
he
it
is
our
friend
sir
henrys
missing
boot
thrown
there
by
stapleton
in
his
flight
exactly
he
retained
it
in
his
hand
after
using
it
to
set
the
hound
upon
the
track
he
fled
when
he
knew
the
game
was
up
still
clutching
it
and
he
hurled
it
away
at
this
point
of
his
flight
we
know
at
least
that
he
came
so
far
in
safety
but
more
than
that
we
were
never
destined
to
know
though
there
was
much
which
we
might
surmise
there
was
no
chance
of
finding
footsteps
in
the
mire
for
the
rising
mud
oozed
swiftly
in
upon
them
but
as
we
at
last
reached
firmer
ground
beyond
the
morass
we
all
looked
eagerly
for
them
but
no
slightest
sign
of
them
ever
met
our
eyes
if
the
earth
told
a
true
story
then
stapleton
never
reached
that
island
of
refuge
towards
which
he
struggled
through
the
fog
upon
that
last
night
somewhere
in
the
heart
of
the
great
grimpen
mire
down
in
the
foul
slime
of
the
huge
morass
which
had
sucked
him
in
this
cold
and
cruel
hearted
man
is
forever
buried
many
traces
we
found
of
him
in
the
bog
girt
island
where
he
had
hid
his
savage
ally
a
huge
driving
wheel
and
a
shaft
half
filled
with
rubbish
showed
the
position
of
an
abandoned
mine
beside
it
were
the
crumbling
remains
of
the
cottages
of
the
miners
driven
away
no
doubt
by
the
foul
reek
of
the
surrounding
swamp
in
one
of
these
a
staple
and
chain
with
a
quantity
of
gnawed
bones
showed
where
the
animal
had
been
confined
a
skeleton
with
a
tangle
of
brown
hair
adhering
to
it
lay
among
the
debris
a
dog
said
holmes
by
jove
a
curly
haired
spaniel
poor
mortimer
will
never
see
his
pet
again
well
i
do
not
know
that
this
place
contains
any
secret
which
we
have
not
already
fathomed
he
could
hide
his
hound
but
he
could
not
hush
its
voice
and
hence
came
those
cries
which
even
in
daylight
were
not
pleasant
to
hear
on
an
emergency
he
could
keep
the
hound
in
the
out
house
at
merripit
but
it
was
always
a
risk
and
it
was
only
on
the
supreme
day
which
he
regarded
as
the
end
of
all
his
efforts
that
he
dared
do
it
this
paste
in
the
tin
is
no
doubt
the
luminous
mixture
with
which
the
creature
was
daubed
it
was
suggested
of
course
by
the
story
of
the
family
hell
hound
and
by
the
desire
to
frighten
old
sir
charles
to
death
no
wonder
the
poor
devil
of
a
convict
ran
and
screamed
even
as
our
friend
did
and
as
we
ourselves
might
have
done
when
he
saw
such
a
creature
bounding
through
the
darkness
of
the
moor
upon
his
track
it
was
a
cunning
device
for
apart
from
the
chance
of
driving
your
victim
to
his
death
what
peasant
would
venture
to
inquire
too
closely
into
such
a
creature
should
he
get
sight
of
it
as
many
have
done
upon
the
moor
i
said
it
in
london
watson
and
i
say
it
again
now
that
never
yet
have
we
helped
to
hunt
down
a
more
dangerous
man
than
he
who
is
lying
yonder
he
swept
his
long
arm
towards
the
huge
mottled
expanse
of
green
splotched
bog
which
stretched
away
until
it
merged
into
the
russet
slopes
of
the
moor
chapter
a
retrospection
it
was
the
end
of
november
and
holmes
and
i
sat
upon
a
raw
and
foggy
night
on
either
side
of
a
blazing
fire
in
our
sitting
room
in
baker
street
since
the
tragic
upshot
of
our
visit
to
devonshire
he
had
been
engaged
in
two
affairs
of
the
utmost
importance
in
the
first
of
which
he
had
exposed
the
atrocious
conduct
of
colonel
upwood
in
connection
with
the
famous
card
scandal
of
the
nonpareil
club
while
in
the
second
he
had
defended
the
unfortunate
mme
montpensier
from
the
charge
of
murder
which
hung
over
her
in
connection
with
the
death
of
her
step
daughter
mlle
carere
the
young
lady
who
as
it
will
be
remembered
was
found
six
months
later
alive
and
married
in
new
york
my
friend
was
in
excellent
spirits
over
the
success
which
had
attended
a
succession
of
difficult
and
important
cases
so
that
i
was
able
to
induce
him
to
discuss
the
details
of
the
baskerville
mystery
i
had
waited
patiently
for
the
opportunity
for
i
was
aware
that
he
would
never
permit
cases
to
overlap
and
that
his
clear
and
logical
mind
would
not
be
drawn
from
its
present
work
to
dwell
upon
memories
of
the
past
sir
henry
and
dr
mortimer
were
however
in
london
on
their
way
to
that
long
voyage
which
had
been
recommended
for
the
restoration
of
his
shattered
nerves
they
had
called
upon
us
that
very
afternoon
so
that
it
was
natural
that
the
subject
should
come
up
for
discussion
the
whole
course
of
events
said
holmes
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
man
who
called
himself
stapleton
was
simple
and
direct
although
to
us
who
had
no
means
in
the
beginning
of
knowing
the
motives
of
his
actions
and
could
only
learn
part
of
the
facts
it
all
appeared
exceedingly
complex
i
have
had
the
advantage
of
two
conversations
with
mrs
stapleton
and
the
case
has
now
been
so
entirely
cleared
up
that
i
am
not
aware
that
there
is
anything
which
has
remained
a
secret
to
us
you
will
find
a
few
notes
upon
the
matter
under
the
heading
b
in
my
indexed
list
of
cases
perhaps
you
would
kindly
give
me
a
sketch
of
the
course
of
events
from
memory
certainly
though
i
cannot
guarantee
that
i
carry
all
the
facts
in
my
mind
intense
mental
concentration
has
a
curious
way
of
blotting
out
what
has
passed
the
barrister
who
has
his
case
at
his
fingers
ends
and
is
able
to
argue
with
an
expert
upon
his
own
subject
finds
that
a
week
or
two
of
the
courts
will
drive
it
all
out
of
his
head
once
more
so
each
of
my
cases
displaces
the
last
and
mlle
carere
has
blurred
my
recollection
of
baskerville
hall
tomorrow
some
other
little
problem
may
be
submitted
to
my
notice
which
will
in
turn
dispossess
the
fair
french
lady
and
the
infamous
upwood
so
far
as
the
case
of
the
hound
goes
however
i
will
give
you
the
course
of
events
as
nearly
as
i
can
and
you
will
suggest
anything
which
i
may
have
forgotten
my
inquiries
show
beyond
all
question
that
the
family
portrait
did
not
lie
and
that
this
fellow
was
indeed
a
baskerville
he
was
a
son
of
that
rodger
baskerville
the
younger
brother
of
sir
charles
who
fled
with
a
sinister
reputation
to
south
america
where
he
was
said
to
have
died
unmarried
he
did
as
a
matter
of
fact
marry
and
had
one
child
this
fellow
whose
real
name
is
the
same
as
his
fathers
he
married
beryl
garcia
one
of
the
beauties
of
costa
rica
and
having
purloined
a
considerable
sum
of
public
money
he
changed
his
name
to
vandeleur
and
fled
to
england
where
he
established
a
school
in
the
east
of
yorkshire
his
reason
for
attempting
this
special
line
of
business
was
that
he
had
struck
up
an
acquaintance
with
a
consumptive
tutor
upon
the
voyage
home
and
that
he
had
used
this
mans
ability
to
make
the
undertaking
a
success
fraser
the
tutor
died
however
and
the
school
which
had
begun
well
sank
from
disrepute
into
infamy
the
vandeleurs
found
it
convenient
to
change
their
name
to
stapleton
and
he
brought
the
remains
of
his
fortune
his
schemes
for
the
future
and
his
taste
for
entomology
to
the
south
of
england
i
learned
at
the
british
museum
that
he
was
a
recognized
authority
upon
the
subject
and
that
the
name
of
vandeleur
has
been
permanently
attached
to
a
certain
moth
which
he
had
in
his
yorkshire
days
been
the
first
to
describe
we
now
come
to
that
portion
of
his
life
which
has
proved
to
be
of
such
intense
interest
to
us
the
fellow
had
evidently
made
inquiry
and
found
that
only
two
lives
intervened
between
him
and
a
valuable
estate
when
he
went
to
devonshire
his
plans
were
i
believe
exceedingly
hazy
but
that
he
meant
mischief
from
the
first
is
evident
from
the
way
in
which
he
took
his
wife
with
him
in
the
character
of
his
sister
the
idea
of
using
her
as
a
decoy
was
clearly
already
in
his
mind
though
he
may
not
have
been
certain
how
the
details
of
his
plot
were
to
be
arranged
he
meant
in
the
end
to
have
the
estate
and
he
was
ready
to
use
any
tool
or
run
any
risk
for
that
end
his
first
act
was
to
establish
himself
as
near
to
his
ancestral
home
as
he
could
and
his
second
was
to
cultivate
a
friendship
with
sir
charles
baskerville
and
with
the
neighbours
the
baronet
himself
told
him
about
the
family
hound
and
so
prepared
the
way
for
his
own
death
stapleton
as
i
will
continue
to
call
him
knew
that
the
old
mans
heart
was
weak
and
that
a
shock
would
kill
him
so
much
he
had
learned
from
dr
mortimer
he
had
heard
also
that
sir
charles
was
superstitious
and
had
taken
this
grim
legend
very
seriously
his
ingenious
mind
instantly
suggested
a
way
by
which
the
baronet
could
be
done
to
death
and
yet
it
would
be
hardly
possible
to
bring
home
the
guilt
to
the
real
murderer
having
conceived
the
idea
he
proceeded
to
carry
it
out
with
considerable
finesse
an
ordinary
schemer
would
have
been
content
to
work
with
a
savage
hound
the
use
of
artificial
means
to
make
the
creature
diabolical
was
a
flash
of
genius
upon
his
part
the
dog
he
bought
in
london
from
ross
and
mangles
the
dealers
in
fulham
road
it
was
the
strongest
and
most
savage
in
their
possession
he
brought
it
down
by
the
north
devon
line
and
walked
a
great
distance
over
the
moor
so
as
to
get
it
home
without
exciting
any
remarks
he
had
already
on
his
insect
hunts
learned
to
penetrate
the
grimpen
mire
and
so
had
found
a
safe
hiding
place
for
the
creature
here
he
kennelled
it
and
waited
his
chance
but
it
was
some
time
coming
the
old
gentleman
could
not
be
decoyed
outside
of
his
grounds
at
night
several
times
stapleton
lurked
about
with
his
hound
but
without
avail
it
was
during
these
fruitless
quests
that
he
or
rather
his
ally
was
seen
by
peasants
and
that
the
legend
of
the
demon
dog
received
a
new
confirmation
he
had
hoped
that
his
wife
might
lure
sir
charles
to
his
ruin
but
here
she
proved
unexpectedly
independent
she
would
not
endeavour
to
entangle
the
old
gentleman
in
a
sentimental
attachment
which
might
deliver
him
over
to
his
enemy
threats
and
even
i
am
sorry
to
say
blows
refused
to
move
her
she
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
and
for
a
time
stapleton
was
at
a
deadlock
he
found
a
way
out
of
his
difficulties
through
the
chance
that
sir
charles
who
had
conceived
a
friendship
for
him
made
him
the
minister
of
his
charity
in
the
case
of
this
unfortunate
woman
mrs
laura
lyons
by
representing
himself
as
a
single
man
he
acquired
complete
influence
over
her
and
he
gave
her
to
understand
that
in
the
event
of
her
obtaining
a
divorce
from
her
husband
he
would
marry
her
his
plans
were
suddenly
brought
to
a
head
by
his
knowledge
that
sir
charles
was
about
to
leave
the
hall
on
the
advice
of
dr
mortimer
with
whose
opinion
he
himself
pretended
to
coincide
he
must
act
at
once
or
his
victim
might
get
beyond
his
power
he
therefore
put
pressure
upon
mrs
lyons
to
write
this
letter
imploring
the
old
man
to
give
her
an
interview
on
the
evening
before
his
departure
for
london
he
then
by
a
specious
argument
prevented
her
from
going
and
so
had
the
chance
for
which
he
had
waited
driving
back
in
the
evening
from
coombe
tracey
he
was
in
time
to
get
his
hound
to
treat
it
with
his
infernal
paint
and
to
bring
the
beast
round
to
the
gate
at
which
he
had
reason
to
expect
that
he
would
find
the
old
gentleman
waiting
the
dog
incited
by
its
master
sprang
over
the
wicket
gate
and
pursued
the
unfortunate
baronet
who
fled
screaming
down
the
yew
alley
in
that
gloomy
tunnel
it
must
indeed
have
been
a
dreadful
sight
to
see
that
huge
black
creature
with
its
flaming
jaws
and
blazing
eyes
bounding
after
its
victim
he
fell
dead
at
the
end
of
the
alley
from
heart
disease
and
terror
the
hound
had
kept
upon
the
grassy
border
while
the
baronet
had
run
down
the
path
so
that
no
track
but
the
mans
was
visible
on
seeing
him
lying
still
the
creature
had
probably
approached
to
sniff
at
him
but
finding
him
dead
had
turned
away
again
it
was
then
that
it
left
the
print
which
was
actually
observed
by
dr
mortimer
the
hound
was
called
off
and
hurried
away
to
its
lair
in
the
grimpen
mire
and
a
mystery
was
left
which
puzzled
the
authorities
alarmed
the
countryside
and
finally
brought
the
case
within
the
scope
of
our
observation
so
much
for
the
death
of
sir
charles
baskerville
you
perceive
the
devilish
cunning
of
it
for
really
it
would
be
almost
impossible
to
make
a
case
against
the
real
murderer
his
only
accomplice
was
one
who
could
never
give
him
away
and
the
grotesque
inconceivable
nature
of
the
device
only
served
to
make
it
more
effective
both
of
the
women
concerned
in
the
case
mrs
stapleton
and
mrs
laura
lyons
were
left
with
a
strong
suspicion
against
stapleton
mrs
stapleton
knew
that
he
had
designs
upon
the
old
man
and
also
of
the
existence
of
the
hound
mrs
lyons
knew
neither
of
these
things
but
had
been
impressed
by
the
death
occurring
at
the
time
of
an
uncancelled
appointment
which
was
only
known
to
him
however
both
of
them
were
under
his
influence
and
he
had
nothing
to
fear
from
them
the
first
half
of
his
task
was
successfully
accomplished
but
the
more
difficult
still
remained
it
is
possible
that
stapleton
did
not
know
of
the
existence
of
an
heir
in
canada
in
any
case
he
would
very
soon
learn
it
from
his
friend
dr
mortimer
and
he
was
told
by
the
latter
all
details
about
the
arrival
of
henry
baskerville
stapletons
first
idea
was
that
this
young
stranger
from
canada
might
possibly
be
done
to
death
in
london
without
coming
down
to
devonshire
at
all
he
distrusted
his
wife
ever
since
she
had
refused
to
help
him
in
laying
a
trap
for
the
old
man
and
he
dared
not
leave
her
long
out
of
his
sight
for
fear
he
should
lose
his
influence
over
her
it
was
for
this
reason
that
he
took
her
to
london
with
him
they
lodged
i
find
at
the
mexborough
private
hotel
in
craven
street
which
was
actually
one
of
those
called
upon
by
my
agent
in
search
of
evidence
here
he
kept
his
wife
imprisoned
in
her
room
while
he
disguised
in
a
beard
followed
dr
mortimer
to
baker
street
and
afterwards
to
the
station
and
to
the
northumberland
hotel
his
wife
had
some
inkling
of
his
plans
but
she
had
such
a
fear
of
her
husband
a
fear
founded
upon
brutal
ill
treatment
that
she
dare
not
write
to
warn
the
man
whom
she
knew
to
be
in
danger
if
the
letter
should
fall
into
stapletons
hands
her
own
life
would
not
be
safe
eventually
as
we
know
she
adopted
the
expedient
of
cutting
out
the
words
which
would
form
the
message
and
addressing
the
letter
in
a
disguised
hand
it
reached
the
baronet
and
gave
him
the
first
warning
of
his
danger
it
was
very
essential
for
stapleton
to
get
some
article
of
sir
henry
attire
so
that
in
case
he
was
driven
to
use
the
dog
he
might
always
have
the
means
of
setting
him
upon
his
track
with
characteristic
promptness
and
audacity
he
set
about
this
at
once
and
we
cannot
doubt
that
the
boots
or
chamber
maid
of
the
hotel
was
well
bribed
to
help
him
in
his
design
by
chance
however
the
first
boot
which
was
procured
for
him
was
a
new
one
and
therefore
useless
for
his
purpose
he
then
had
it
returned
and
obtained
another
a
most
instructive
incident
since
it
proved
conclusively
to
my
mind
that
we
were
dealing
with
a
real
hound
as
no
other
supposition
could
explain
this
anxiety
to
obtain
an
old
boot
and
this
indifference
to
a
new
one
the
more
outre
and
grotesque
an
incident
is
the
more
carefully
it
deserves
to
be
examined
and
the
very
point
which
appears
to
complicate
a
case
is
when
duly
considered
and
scientifically
handled
the
one
which
is
most
likely
to
elucidate
it
then
we
had
the
visit
from
our
friends
next
morning
shadowed
always
by
stapleton
in
the
cab
from
his
knowledge
of
our
rooms
and
of
my
appearance
as
well
as
from
his
general
conduct
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
stapletons
career
of
crime
has
been
by
no
means
limited
to
this
single
baskerville
affair
it
is
suggestive
that
during
the
last
three
years
there
have
been
four
considerable
burglaries
in
the
west
country
for
none
of
which
was
any
criminal
ever
arrested
the
last
of
these
at
folkestone
court
in
may
was
remarkable
for
the
cold
blooded
pistolling
of
the
page
who
surprised
the
masked
and
solitary
burglar
i
cannot
doubt
that
stapleton
recruited
his
waning
resources
in
this
fashion
and
that
for
years
he
has
been
a
desperate
and
dangerous
man
we
had
an
example
of
his
readiness
of
resource
that
morning
when
he
got
away
from
us
so
successfully
and
also
of
his
audacity
in
sending
back
my
own
name
to
me
through
the
cabman
from
that
moment
he
understood
that
i
had
taken
over
the
case
in
london
and
that
therefore
there
was
no
chance
for
him
there
he
returned
to
dartmoor
and
awaited
the
arrival
of
the
baronet
one
moment
said
i
you
have
no
doubt
described
the
sequence
of
events
correctly
but
there
is
one
point
which
you
have
left
unexplained
what
became
of
the
hound
when
its
master
was
in
london
i
have
given
some
attention
to
this
matter
and
it
is
undoubtedly
of
importance
there
can
be
no
question
that
stapleton
had
a
confidant
though
it
is
unlikely
that
he
ever
placed
himself
in
his
power
by
sharing
all
his
plans
with
him
there
was
an
old
manservant
at
merripit
house
whose
name
was
anthony
his
connection
with
the
stapletons
can
be
traced
for
several
years
as
far
back
as
the
school
mastering
days
so
that
he
must
have
been
aware
that
his
master
and
mistress
were
really
husband
and
wife
this
man
has
disappeared
and
has
escaped
from
the
country
it
is
suggestive
that
anthony
is
not
a
common
name
in
england
while
antonio
is
so
in
all
spanish
or
spanish
american
countries
the
man
like
mrs
stapleton
herself
spoke
good
english
but
with
a
curious
lisping
accent
i
have
myself
seen
this
old
man
cross
the
grimpen
mire
by
the
path
which
stapleton
had
marked
out
it
is
very
probable
therefore
that
in
the
absence
of
his
master
it
was
he
who
cared
for
the
hound
though
he
may
never
have
known
the
purpose
for
which
the
beast
was
used
the
stapletons
then
went
down
to
devonshire
whither
they
were
soon
followed
by
sir
henry
and
you
one
word
now
as
to
how
i
stood
myself
at
that
time
it
may
possibly
recur
to
your
memory
that
when
i
examined
the
paper
upon
which
the
printed
words
were
fastened
i
made
a
close
inspection
for
the
water
mark
in
doing
so
i
held
it
within
a
few
inches
of
my
eyes
and
was
conscious
of
a
faint
smell
of
the
scent
known
as
white
jessamine
there
are
seventy
five
perfumes
which
it
is
very
necessary
that
a
criminal
expert
should
be
able
to
distinguish
from
each
other
and
cases
have
more
than
once
within
my
own
experience
depended
upon
their
prompt
recognition
the
scent
suggested
the
presence
of
a
lady
and
already
my
thoughts
began
to
turn
towards
the
stapletons
thus
i
had
made
certain
of
the
hound
and
had
guessed
at
the
criminal
before
ever
we
went
to
the
west
country
it
was
my
game
to
watch
stapleton
it
was
evident
however
that
i
could
not
do
this
if
i
were
with
you
since
he
would
be
keenly
on
his
guard
i
deceived
everybody
therefore
yourself
included
and
i
came
down
secretly
when
i
was
supposed
to
be
in
london
my
hardships
were
not
so
great
as
you
imagined
though
such
trifling
details
must
never
interfere
with
the
investigation
of
a
case
i
stayed
for
the
most
part
at
coombe
tracey
and
only
used
the
hut
upon
the
moor
when
it
was
necessary
to
be
near
the
scene
of
action
cartwright
had
come
down
with
me
and
in
his
disguise
as
a
country
boy
he
was
of
great
assistance
to
me
i
was
dependent
upon
him
for
food
and
clean
linen
when
i
was
watching
stapleton
cartwright
was
frequently
watching
you
so
that
i
was
able
to
keep
my
hand
upon
all
the
strings
i
have
already
told
you
that
your
reports
reached
me
rapidly
being
forwarded
instantly
from
baker
street
to
coombe
tracey
they
were
of
great
service
to
me
and
especially
that
one
incidentally
truthful
piece
of
biography
of
stapletons
i
was
able
to
establish
the
identity
of
the
man
and
the
woman
and
knew
at
last
exactly
how
i
stood
the
case
had
been
considerably
complicated
through
the
incident
of
the
escaped
convict
and
the
relations
between
him
and
the
barrymores
this
also
you
cleared
up
in
a
very
effective
way
though
i
had
already
come
to
the
same
conclusions
from
my
own
observations
by
the
time
that
you
discovered
me
upon
the
moor
i
had
a
complete
knowledge
of
the
whole
business
but
i
had
not
a
case
which
could
go
to
a
jury
even
stapletons
attempt
upon
sir
henry
that
night
which
ended
in
the
death
of
the
unfortunate
convict
did
not
help
us
much
in
proving
murder
against
our
man
there
seemed
to
be
no
alternative
but
to
catch
him
red
handed
and
to
do
so
we
had
to
use
sir
henry
alone
and
apparently
unprotected
as
a
bait
we
did
so
and
at
the
cost
of
a
severe
shock
to
our
client
we
succeeded
in
completing
our
case
and
driving
stapleton
to
his
destruction
that
sir
henry
should
have
been
exposed
to
this
is
i
must
confess
a
reproach
to
my
management
of
the
case
but
we
had
no
means
of
foreseeing
the
terrible
and
paralyzing
spectacle
which
the
beast
presented
nor
could
we
predict
the
fog
which
enabled
him
to
burst
upon
us
at
such
short
notice
we
succeeded
in
our
object
at
a
cost
which
both
the
specialist
and
dr
mortimer
assure
me
will
be
a
temporary
one
a
long
journey
may
enable
our
friend
to
recover
not
only
from
his
shattered
nerves
but
also
from
his
wounded
feelings
his
love
for
the
lady
was
deep
and
sincere
and
to
him
the
saddest
part
of
all
this
black
business
was
that
he
should
have
been
deceived
by
her
it
only
remains
to
indicate
the
part
which
she
had
played
throughout
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
stapleton
exercised
an
influence
over
her
which
may
have
been
love
or
may
have
been
fear
or
very
possibly
both
since
they
are
by
no
means
incompatible
emotions
it
was
at
least
absolutely
effective
at
his
command
she
consented
to
pass
as
his
sister
though
he
found
the
limits
of
his
power
over
her
when
he
endeavoured
to
make
her
the
direct
accessory
to
murder
she
was
ready
to
warn
sir
henry
so
far
as
she
could
without
implicating
her
husband
and
again
and
again
she
tried
to
do
so
stapleton
himself
seems
to
have
been
capable
of
jealousy
and
when
he
saw
the
baronet
paying
court
to
the
lady
even
though
it
was
part
of
his
own
plan
still
he
could
not
help
interrupting
with
a
passionate
outburst
which
revealed
the
fiery
soul
which
his
self
contained
manner
so
cleverly
concealed
by
encouraging
the
intimacy
he
made
it
certain
that
sir
henry
would
frequently
come
to
merripit
house
and
that
he
would
sooner
or
later
get
the
opportunity
which
he
desired
on
the
day
of
the
crisis
however
his
wife
turned
suddenly
against
him
she
had
learned
something
of
the
death
of
the
convict
and
she
knew
that
the
hound
was
being
kept
in
the
outhouse
on
the
evening
that
sir
henry
was
coming
to
dinner
she
taxed
her
husband
with
his
intended
crime
and
a
furious
scene
followed
in
which
he
showed
her
for
the
first
time
that
she
had
a
rival
in
his
love
her
fidelity
turned
in
an
instant
to
bitter
hatred
and
he
saw
that
she
would
betray
him
he
tied
her
up
therefore
that
she
might
have
no
chance
of
warning
sir
henry
and
he
hoped
no
doubt
that
when
the
whole
countryside
put
down
the
baronets
death
to
the
curse
of
his
family
as
they
certainly
would
do
he
could
win
his
wife
back
to
accept
an
accomplished
fact
and
to
keep
silent
upon
what
she
knew
in
this
i
fancy
that
in
any
case
he
made
a
miscalculation
and
that
if
we
had
not
been
there
his
doom
would
none
the
less
have
been
sealed
a
woman
of
spanish
blood
does
not
condone
such
an
injury
so
lightly
and
now
my
dear
watson
without
referring
to
my
notes
i
cannot
give
you
a
more
detailed
account
of
this
curious
case
i
do
not
know
that
anything
essential
has
been
left
unexplained
he
could
not
hope
to
frighten
sir
henry
to
death
as
he
had
done
the
old
uncle
with
his
bogie
hound
the
beast
was
savage
and
half
starved
if
its
appearance
did
not
frighten
its
victim
to
death
at
least
it
would
paralyze
the
resistance
which
might
be
offered
no
doubt
there
only
remains
one
difficulty
if
stapleton
came
into
the
succession
how
could
he
explain
the
fact
that
he
the
heir
had
been
living
unannounced
under
another
name
so
close
to
the
property
how
could
he
claim
it
without
causing
suspicion
and
inquiry
it
is
a
formidable
difficulty
and
i
fear
that
you
ask
too
much
when
you
expect
me
to
solve
it
the
past
and
the
present
are
within
the
field
of
my
inquiry
but
what
a
man
may
do
in
the
future
is
a
hard
question
to
answer
mrs
stapleton
has
heard
her
husband
discuss
the
problem
on
several
occasions
there
were
three
possible
courses
he
might
claim
the
property
from
south
america
establish
his
identity
before
the
british
authorities
there
and
so
obtain
the
fortune
without
ever
coming
to
england
at
all
or
he
might
adopt
an
elaborate
disguise
during
the
short
time
that
he
need
be
in
london
or
again
he
might
furnish
an
accomplice
with
the
proofs
and
papers
putting
him
in
as
heir
and
retaining
a
claim
upon
some
proportion
of
his
income
we
cannot
doubt
from
what
we
know
of
him
that
he
would
have
found
some
way
out
of
the
difficulty
and
now
my
dear
watson
we
have
had
some
weeks
of
severe
work
and
for
one
evening
i
think
we
may
turn
our
thoughts
into
more
pleasant
channels
i
have
a
box
for
les
huguenots
have
you
heard
the
de
reszkes
might
i
trouble
you
then
to
be
ready
in
half
an
hour
and
we
can
stop
at
marcinis
for
a
little
dinner
on
the
way
