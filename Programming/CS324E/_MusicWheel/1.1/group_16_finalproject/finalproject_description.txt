Our project is a music visualization tool that allows the user to see different chords and how they appear geometrically. It also includes three different modes that the wheel can be used in: Free mode, instrument mode, and song mode, which are explained in more detail in the README file. 

The biggest challenges were getting a song editor to work nicely with reading input and then playing that input in a song form. 

Kenneth Small worked on the Song Editor, which allowed the user to generate chord progressions, 
or "songs" that could be played in Song Mode. 

Matthew Wimberley and Stephen Rauner worked on the main interface and modes of the music wheel.
