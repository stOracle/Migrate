This project is a music wheel for visualizing chords and music.

There are 3 modes as well as a song editor for the song mode.

Free Mode: Buttons on the wheel can be clicked and will play or stop indefinitely when clicked.
	   The left and right arrow keys can be used to rotate the wheel by half a note
	   to change the pitch, while the up and down arrow keys can be used to rotate
	   the wheel an entire octave. 

Instrument Mode: Buttons on the wheel are activated with buttons 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 - =
		 with 1 being the bottom button traversing clockwise around the wheel. In
		 this mode buttons will play their note only while the corresponding
		 keyboard input is held. Arrow keys perform the same action as Free Mode.

Song Mode: In song mode the user can choose to begin the built in chord progression with 
	   the spacebar and then progress to the next line of the song with the right arrow key
	   a pace of their choosing. Alternatively, you can play the custom song from the
	   editor by pressing the 'a' key and progress with the right arrow key (playing a
	   custom song does not use the wheel as it can use any note from the programs entire 
	   range at once and thus would not fit on the wheel. The default custom song should be
	   very recognizeable.)

Song Editor: Allows the user to generate chord progressions, or "songs" that could be played in Song Mode. 
New chords are constructed in the green zone by clicking the buttons immediately to the right. They are 
deleted the same way. Notes can be made sharp or flat by clicking on the black notes that appear. 
Which chord is currently in the green zone can be changed by clicking the triple arrow buttons to "scroll" 
thru the song. Clicking Save! saves the song to "song.txt" and closes the editor. It can then be played in Song Mode. 
Clicking the Revert button resets the editor to the original song.

The MUTEALL button will mute all sounds and reset regardless of mode.
