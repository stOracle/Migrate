To run our file, you will need to download and import the Sound library by The Processing Foundation. 
It can then be played by pressing the play button in processing. I believe it is only a processing bug on my end
as this didn't happen with other group members, but if it returns an error in the editor.py about sound.txt
not being available just save editor.py and rerun and that caused it to work fine. 

Currently the main screen will allow you to play several notes at a time with a master mute button.
Notes can be played and muted by clicking on their buttons on the wheel.

Lines drawn between played notes will be added in the future with other features, along with updates
to the song editor. A large portion of the underlying engine for future features has been completed
in the Music.py file and just needs to be 'connected' with the main functionalities.
