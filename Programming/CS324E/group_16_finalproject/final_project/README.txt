MODES:

-There are three functions within our project: Free, Instrument, and Song
	-Free mode is a free play, where the user can click on various notes to     	 construct chords or intervals.
	-Instrument mode uses the keyboard as a piano keyboard, in which the 
	 user can see what chords they are physically playing.
	-Song mode pulls from a txt file of chords and plays the progression 
	 in 4/4 time. There is a demo file included and there is also a Song Editor
	 in which a user can make their own progression.
