Kenneth Small worked on the GUI for the RSS Reader. Matthew Wimberley assisted by coding most of RSSData.py which contains the classes used to retrieve and process raw XML data into useable form by the RSS Reader.

The RSS Reader receives five different feeds from BBC that correspond to the five colors in the Reader. The user can switch between which feed to view, and cycle through the various titles with the Next and Prev buttons. By default, the Reader displays a mix of all the feeds. Mousing over a title displays a more detailed description (as well as publication date) in the window on the right. Clicking a title opens the default browser to a related page. The user may click "Update Feeds" at any time to get the latest.
