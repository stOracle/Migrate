The game is a timed maze game where the player can use items to assist in reaching the finish.
Items include markers that help the player to nagivate, clocks that can be used to add more time,
and bombs that can be used to destroy walls of the maze. A score based on time and items remaining 
is awarded to a player who reaches the finish and "wins". No score is given to a player who runs out 
of time and "loses".

There are two separate supporting .py files, one for the GUI and one for the game engine.

In the GUI file are classes for displaying windows, buttons, and text. The GUI allows for a 
parent-child relation between GUI objects that allows certain GUI elements to be grouped together.

In the game engine file are the necessary classes for displaying, updating, and managing interaction
between game objects. The Actor class is the super class to most game objects. It also contains functions 
that manage the game rules and makes use of the GUI to display certain game elements.

The main .pyde file makes use of the other two .py files to build a game world and maintain constant checks
on engine functions such as checking for collision. 

Kenneth Small was responsible for implementing the GUI classes allowing for the creation of windows, buttons, and text.

Matthew Wimberley was responsible for creation of the game engine and game functionality.

Stephen Rauner was reponsible for creation and design of the maze and game world.
